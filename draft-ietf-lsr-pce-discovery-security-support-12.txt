  IGP extension for PCEP security capability support in PCE discovery
            draft-ietf-lsr-pce-discovery-security-support-12

Abstract

   When a Path Computation Element (PCE) is a Label Switching Router
   (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a
   server participating in the IGP, its presence and path computation
   capabilities can be advertised using IGP flooding.  The IGP
   extensions for PCE discovery (RFC 5088 and RFC 5089) define a method
   to advertise path computation capabilities using IGP flooding for
   OSPF and IS-IS respectively.  However these specifications lack a
   method to advertise PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) security (e.g.,
   Transport Layer Security (TLS), TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO))
   support capability.

   This document defines capability flag bits for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-
   TLV that can be announced as an attribute in the IGP advertisement to
   distribute PCEP security support information.  In addition, this
   document updates RFC 5088 and RFC 5089 to allow advertisement of a
   Key ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV to support TCP-AO security
   capability.  Further, this document updates RFC 8231, and RFC 8306.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC5440], PCEP communication privacy is one
   important issue, as an attacker that intercepts a Path Computation
   Element (PCE) message could obtain sensitive information related to
   computed paths and resources.

   Among the possible solutions mentioned in that document, Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] provides support for peer
   authentication, and message encryption and integrity while TCP
   Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] and Cryptographic Algorithms
   for TCP-AO [RFC5926] offer significantly improved security for
   applications using TCP.  As specified in section 4 of [RFC8253], in
   order for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to establish a connection
   with a PCE server using TLS or TCP-AO, the PCC needs to know whether
   PCE server supports TLS or TCP-AO as a secure transport.

   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] define a method to advertise path computation
   capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF and IS-IS respectively.
   However, these specifications lack a method to advertise PCEP
   security (e.g., TLS) support capability.

   This document defines capability flag bits for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-
   TLV that can be announced as attributes in the IGP advertisement to
   distribute PCEP security support information.  In addition, this
   document updates [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] to allow advertisement of a
   Key ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV to support TCP-AO security
   capability.

   As per [RFC5088], the IANA created a top-level OSPF registry, the
   "Path Computation Element (PCE) Capability Flags" registry.  This
   document updates [RFC5088] and moves the registry to "Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Parameters".  Further, this document updates
   [RFC8231] where it references the registry location as "Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) Parameters" registry to "Interior Gateway Protocol
   (IGP) Parameters" registry.  This document updates [RFC8306] where it
   uses the term "OSPF PCE Capability Flag" and request assignment from
   OSPF Parameters registry with "PCE Capability Flag" and the IGP
   Parameters registry.

   Note that [RFC5557] uses the term "OSPF registry" instead of the "IGP
   registry" whereas [RFC8623] and [RFC9168] uses the term "OSPF
   Parameters" instead of "IGP Parameters".

   Note that the PCEP Open message exchange is another way to discover
   PCE capabilities information, but in this instance, the TCP security
   related key parameters need to be known before the PCEP session is
   established and the PCEP Open messages are exchanged.  Thus, the use
   of the PCE discovery and capabilities advertisement of the IGP needs
   to be leveraged.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IGP extension for PCEP security capability support

   [RFC5088] defines a PCE Discovery (PCED) TLV carried in an OSPF
   Router Information Link State Advertisement (LSA) as defined in
   [RFC7770] to facilitate PCE discovery using OSPF.  This document
   defines two capability flag bits in the OSPF PCE Capability Flags to
   indicate TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) support
   [RFC5925][RFC5926] and PCEP over TLS support [RFC8253] respectively.

   Similarly, [RFC5089] defines the PCED sub-TLV for use in PCE
   discovery using IS-IS.  This document will use the same flag for the
   OSPF PCE Capability Flags sub-TLV to allow IS-IS to indicate TCP
   Authentication Option (TCP-AO) support, PCEP over TLS support
   respectively.

   The IANA assignments for shared OSPF and IS-IS Security Capability
   Flags are documented in Section 8.1 ("PCE Capability Flags") of this
   document.

3.1.  Use of PCEP security capability support for PCE discovery

   TCP-AO, PCEP over TLS support flag bits are advertised using IGP
   flooding.

   *  PCE supports TCP-AO: IGP advertisement SHOULD include TCP-AO
      support flag bit.

   *  PCE supports TLS: IGP advertisement SHOULD include PCEP over TLS
      support flag bit.

Internet-Draft     IGP Ext for PCEP Security Discovery      October 2022


   If the PCE supports multiple security mechanisms, it SHOULD include
   all corresponding flag bits in its IGP advertisement.

   A client's configuration MAY indicate that support for a given
   security capability is required.  If a client is configured to
   require that its PCE server supports TCP-AO, the client MUST verify
   that the TCP-AO flag bit in the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV for a given
   server is set before it opens a connection to that server.
   Similarly, if the client is configured to require that its PCE server
   supports TLS, the client MUST verify that the PCEP over TLS support
   flag bit in the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV for a given server is set
   before it opens a connection to that server.

3.2.  KEY-ID Sub-TLV

   The KEY-ID sub-TLV specifies an identifier that can be used by the
   PCC to identify the TCP-AO key [RFC5925] (referred to as KeyID).

3.2.1.  IS-IS

   The KEY-ID sub-TLV MAY be present in the PCED sub-TLV carried within
   the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV when the capability flag bit of PCE-
   CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV in IS-IS is set to indicate TCP Authentication
   Option (TCP-AO) support.

   The KEY-ID sub-TLV has the following format:

      Type: 6

      Length: 1

      KeyID: The one octet Key ID as per [RFC5925] to uniquely identify
      the Master Key Tuple (MKT).

3.2.2.  OSPF

   Similarly, this sub-TLV MAY be present in the PCED TLV carried within
   OSPF Router Information LSA when the capability flag bit of PCE-CAP-
   FLAGS sub-TLV in OSPF is set to indicate TCP-AO support.

   The format of KEY-ID sub-TLV is as follows:

      KeyID: The one octet Key ID as per [RFC5925] to uniquely identify
      the Master Key Tuple (MKT).

      Reserved: MUST be set to zero while sending and ignored on
      receipt.

3.3.  KEY-CHAIN-NAME Sub-TLV

   The KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLV specifies a keychain name that can be used
   by the PCC to identify the keychain.  The keychain name could be
   manually configured via CLI or installed in the YANG datastore (see
   [RFC8177]) at the PCC.

3.3.1.  IS-IS

   The KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLV MAY be present in the PCED sub-TLV carried
   within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV when the capability flag bit
   of the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV in IS-IS is set to indicate TCP
   Authentication Option (TCP-AO) support.

   The KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLV has the following format:

      Type: 7

      Length: Variable, encodes the length of the value field.

      Key Name: The Key Chain Name contains a string of 1 to 255 octets
      to be used to identify the key chain.  It MUST be encoded using
      UTF-8.  A receiving entity MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8
      sequences.  This field is not NULL terminated.  UTF-8 "Shortest
      Form" encoding is REQUIRED to guard against the technical issues
      outlined in [UTR36].

3.3.2.  OSPF

   Similarly, this sub-TLV MAY be present in the PCED TLV carried within
   the OSPF Router Information LSA when the capability flag bit of PCE-
   CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV in OSPF is set to indicate TCP-AO support.  The
   sub-TLV MUST be zero-padded so that the sub-TLV is 4-octet aligned.

   The format of KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLV is as follows:

                        1                   2                   3

   //                     Key Chain Name                          //
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type: 7

      Length: Variable, padding is not included in the Length field

      Key Name: The Key Chain Name contains a string of 1 to 255 octets
      to be used to identify the key chain.  It MUST be encoded using
      UTF-8.  A receiving entity MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8
      sequences.  This field is not NULL terminated.  UTF-8 "Shortest
      Form" encoding is REQUIRED to guard against the technical issues
      outlined in [UTR36].  The sub-TLV MUST be zero-padded so that the
      sub-TLV is 4-octet aligned.

4.  Update to RFCs

   Section 4 of [RFC5088] states that no new sub-TLVs will be added to
   the PCED TLV, and no new PCE information will be carried in the
   Router Information LSA.  This document updates [RFC5088] by allowing
   the two sub-TLVs defined in this document to be carried in the PCED
   TLV advertised in the Router Information LSA.

   Section 4 of [RFC5089] states that no new sub-TLVs will be added to
   the PCED TLV, and no new PCE information will be carried in the
   Router CAPABLITY TLV.  This document updates [RFC5089] by allowing
   the two sub-TLVs defined in this document to be carried in the PCED
   TLV advertised in the Router CAPABILITY TLV.

   This introduction of additional sub-TLVs should be viewed as an
   exception to the [RFC5088][RFC5089] policy, justified by the
   requirement to discover the PCEP security support prior to

Internet-Draft     IGP Ext for PCEP Security Discovery      October 2022


   establishing a PCEP session.  The restrictions defined in
   [RFC5088][RFC5089] should still be considered to be in place.  If in
   the future new advertisements are required, alternative mechanisms
   such as using [RFC6823] or [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospf-transport-instance]
   should be considered.

   The registry for the PCE Capability Flags assigned in section 8.3 of
   [RFC5557], section 8.1 of [RFC8231], section 6.9 of [RFC8306],
   section 11.1 of [RFC8623], and section 10.5 of [RFC9168] has changed
   to the IGP Parameters "Path Computation Element (PCE) Capability
   Flags" registry created in this document.

5.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   An LSR that does not support the IGP PCE capability bits specified in
   this document silently ignores those bits.

   An LSR that does not support the KEY-ID and KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLVs
   specified in this document silently ignores these sub-TLVs.

   IGP extensions defined in this document do not introduce any new
   interoperability issues.

6.  Management Considerations

   A configuration option may be provided for advertising and
   withdrawing PCEP security capability via OSPF and IS-IS.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations as specified by [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] are
   applicable to this document.

   As described in Section 10.2 of [RFC5440], an PCEP speaker MUST
   support TCP MD5 [RFC2385], so no capability advertisement is needed
   to indicate support.  However, as noted in [RFC6952], TCP MD5 has
   been obsoleted by TCP-AO [RFC5925] because of security concerns.
   However, TCP-AO is not widely implemented and so it is, therefore,
   RECOMMENDED (per [RFC8253] which updates [RFC5440]) that PCEP is
   secured using TLS.  In any case, an implementation SHOULD offer at
   least one of the two security capabilities defined in this document.

   The information related to PCEP security is sensitive and due care
   needs to be taken by the operator.  This document defines new
   capability bits that are susceptible to a downgrade attack by setting
   them to zero.  The content of Key ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV can be
   altered to enable an on-path attack.  Thus, before advertising the
   PCEP security parameters, using the mechanism described in this

Internet-Draft     IGP Ext for PCEP Security Discovery      October 2022


   document, the IGP MUST be known to provide authentication and
   integrity for the PCED TLV using the mechanisms defined in [RFC5304],
   [RFC5310] or [RFC5709].

   Moreover, as stated in the Security Considerations of [RFC5088] and
   [RFC5089], there are no mechanisms defined in OSPF or IS-IS to
   protect the confidentiality of the PCED TLV.  For this reason, the
   operator must ensure that no private data is carried in the TLV, e.g.
   that key-ids or key-chain names do not reveal sensitive information
   about the network.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  PCE Capability Flags

   IANA is requested to move the "Path Computation Element (PCE)
   Capability Flags" registry from the "Open Shortest Path First v2
   (OSPFv2) Parameters" grouping to the "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
   Parameters" grouping.

   IANA is requested to make the following additional assignments from
   the "Path Computation Element (PCE) Capability Flags" registry.

        Bit           Capability Description  Reference
        xx            TCP-AO Support          [This.I.D]
        xx            PCEP over TLS support   [This.I.D]

   The grouping is located at: https://www.iana.org/assignments/igp-
   parameters/igp-parameters.xhtml.

8.2.  PCED sub-TLV Type Indicators

   The PCED sub-TLVs were defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089], but they
   did not create a registry for it.  This document requests IANA to
   create a new registry called "PCED sub-TLV type indicators" under the
   "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Parameters" grouping.  The
   registration policy for this registry is "Standards Action"
   [RFC8126].  Values in this registry come from the range 0-65535.

   This registry should be populated with:
