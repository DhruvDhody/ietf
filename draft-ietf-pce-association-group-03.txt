  PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs
                  draft-ietf-pce-association-group-03

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs in the context of a PCE.  This grouping can then be used to
   define associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and
   a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviors),
   and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and passive modes)
   and stateless PCE.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   enables the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, for the purpose
   of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well as
   Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path
   (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]  specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657] and focuses on a
   model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control over them is
   delegated to the PCE.  The model of operation where LSPs are
   initiated from the PCE is described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs.  This grouping can then be used to define associations between
   sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such
   as configuration parameters or behaviors), and is equally applicable
   to the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE and a stateless
   PCE.  The associations could be created dynamically and conveyed to a
   PCEP peer within PCEP, or it could be configured by an operator on
   the PCEP peers.  Refer Section 3.2 for more details.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC8051]: Stateful
   PCE, Delegation.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]: Redelegation Timeout Interval, LSP State
   Report, LSP Update Request.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]: PCE-initiated LSP, LSP Initiate.

   The following term is defined in this document:

   Association Timeout Interval: when a PCEP session is terminated, a
   PCC waits for this time period before deleting associations created
   by the PCEP peer.

3.  Architectural Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   Stateful PCE provides the ability to update existing LSPs and to
   instantiate new ones.  To enable support for PCE-controlled make-
   before-break and for protection, there is a need to define
   associations between LSPs.  For example, the association between the
   original and the re-optimized path in the make-before break scenario,
   or between the working and protection path in end-to-end protection.
   Another use for LSP grouping is for applying a common set of
   configuration parameters or behaviors to a set of LSPs.

   For a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path
   computation request to an association group, thus enabling it to
   associate a common set of policy, configuration parameters or
   behaviors with the request.

   Some associations could be created dynamically, such as association
   between the working and protections LSPs of a tunnel.  Where as some
   association could be created by the operator manually, such as policy
   based association, where the LSP could join an operator-configured
   existing association.

   Rather than creating separate mechanisms for each use case, this
   draft defines a generic mechanism that can be reused as needed.

3.2.  Operation Overview

   LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they interact by
   adding them to a common association group.  Association groups as
   defined in this document can be applied to LSPs originating at the
   same head end or different head ends.

   Some associations could be created dynamically by a PCEP speaker and
   the associations (along with the set of LSPs) are conveyed to a PCEP
   peer.  Whereas, some associations are configured by the operator on
   the PCEP peers involved before hand, a PCEP speaker then could ask
   for a LSP to join the operator-configured association.  Usage of
   dynamic and configured is usually dependent on the type of the
   association.

   For the operator-configured association, the association identifier,
   type, as well as the association source IP address is manually
   configured by the operator.  In case of dynamic association, the
   association identifier is allocated dynamically by the PCEP speaker.
   A range of association identifier is marked for operator-configured
   associations.  The dynamically created association can then be

Internet-Draft            PCE association group                 May 2017


   reported to the PCEP peer via the PCEP messages as per the stateful
   extensions.  The association are properties of the LSP and could be
   stored in the LSP state database.  Thus, the dynamic association
   exist as long as the LSP state.  In case of PCEP session termination,
   the LSP state clean up SHOULD also take care of associations.

   Multiple types of associations can exist, each with their own
   association identifier space.  The definition of the different
   association types and their behaviors is outside the scope of this
   document.  The establishment and removal of the association
   relationship can be done on a per LSP basis.  An LSP may join
   multiple association groups, of different or of the same association
   type.

4.  ASSOCIATION Object

4.1.  Object Definition

   Association groups and their memberships are defined using a new
   ASSOCIATION object.

   ASSOCIATION Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (TBD).

   ASSOCIATION Object-Type is 1 for IPv4 and its format is shown in
   Figure 1:

   Reserved: 16 bits - MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt.

   Flags: 16 bits - The following flags are currently defined:

   R (Removal - 1 bit):  when set, the requesting PCE peer requires the
      removal of an LSP from the association group.

   Association type: 16 bits - the association type (for example
   protection).  The association type will be defined in separate
   documents.

   Association ID: 16 bits - the identifier of the association group.
   When combined with Type and Association Source, this value uniquely
   identifies an association group.  The value 0xffff and 0x0 are
   reserved.  The value 0xffff is used to indicate all association
   groups.  To accommodate more number of associations, Extended
   Association ID TLV can be included.  In case of the operator-
   configured association, this field is set to 0x0 and the association
   identifier is encoded in the Extended Association ID TLV.

   Association Source: 4 or 16 bytes - An IPv4 or IPv6 address.  This
   could be the IP address of the PCEP speaker that created a dynamic
   association, an operator configured IP address, or an IP address
   selected as per the local policy.  The value such as 0.0.0.0 or
   ::/128 are acceptable.

   Optional TLVs: The optional TLVs follow the PCEP TLV format of
   [RFC5440].  This document defines two optional TLVs.  Other documents
   can define more TLVs.

   encode the association ID from the association identifier range
   carved out for the operator-configured associations.  This is done to
   avoid any conflict in association identifier between the manual
   configurations and the dynamic associations.

4.2.  Object Encoding in PCEP messages

4.2.1.  Stateful PCEP messages

   The ASSOCIATION Object is OPTIONAL and MAY be carried in the Path
   Computation Update (PCUpd), Path Computation Report (PCRpt) and Path
   Computation Initiate (PCInitiate) messages.

   When carried in PCRpt message, it is used to report the association
   group membership information pertaining to a LSP to a stateful PCE.
   It can also be used to remove an LSP from one or more association
   groups by setting the R flag to 1 in the ASSOCIATION object.  Unless,
   a PCE wants to delete an association from an LSP, it does not need to
   carry the ASSOCIATION object in future messages.

   The PCRpt message is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   updated as below:


      <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                             <state-report-list>
      Where:

         <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

         <state-report> ::= [<SRP>]
                            <LSP>
                            [<association-list>]
                            <path>
       Where:
         <path>::= <intended-path>
                   [<actual-attribute-list><actual-path>]
                   <intended-attribute-list>


         <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   When an LSP is delegated to a stateful PCE, the stateful PCE can
   initiate a new association group for this LSP, or associate it with
   one or more existing association groups.  This is done by including
   the ASSOCIATION Object in a PCUpd message.  A stateful PCE can also
   remove a delegated LSP from one or more association groups by setting
   the R flag to 1 in the ASSOCIATION object.

   The PCUpd message is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   updated as below:

       <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                           <update-request-list>
    Where:

       <update-request-list> ::= <update-request>[<update-request-list>]

       <update-request> ::= <SRP>
                            <LSP>
                            [<association-list>]
                            <path>
    Where:
       <path>::= <intended-path><intended-attribute-list>

       <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   A PCE initiating a new LSP, can include the association group
   information.  This is done by including the ASSOCIATION Object in a
   PCInitiate message.  The PCInitiate message is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] and updated as below:

     <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                              <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
  Where:

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-list> ::= <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>
                                  [<PCE-initiated-lsp-list>]

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-request> ::= (<PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation>|
                                      <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion>)

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation> ::= <SRP>
                                           <LSP>
                                           [<END-POINTS>]
                                           <ERO>
                                           [<association-list>]
                                           [<attribute-list>]

  Where:
     <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

4.2.2.  Request Message

   In case of passive stateful or stateless PCE, the ASSOCIATION Object
   is OPTIONAL and MAY be carried in the Path Computation Request
   (PCReq) message.

Internet-Draft            PCE association group                 May 2017


   When carried in a PCReq message, the ASSOCIATION Object is used to
   associate the path computation request to an association group.  The
   association (and the other LSPs) should be known to the PCE before
   hand.  These could be operator-configured or dynamically learned
   before.  The R flag in ASSOCIATION object within PCReq message MUST
   be set to 0 while sending and ignored on receipt.

   The PCReq message is defined in [RFC5440] and updated in [I-D.ietf-
   pce-stateful-pce], it is further updated below for association:

   <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                      [<svec-list>]
                      <request-list>

   Where:
         <svec-list>::= <SVEC>[<svec-list>]
         <request-list>::= <request>[<request-list>]

         <request>::= <RP>
                      <END-POINTS>
                      [<LSP>]
                      [<LSPA>]
                      [<BANDWIDTH>]
                      [<metric-list>]
                      [<association-list>]
                      [<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>]]
                      [<IRO>]
                      [<LOAD-BALANCING>]

   Where:
         <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   Note that LSP object MAY be present for the passive stateful PCE
   mode.

4.3.  Processing Rules

   Association groups can be operator-configured on the necessary PCC
   and PCE.  Both a PCC and a PCE can create association groups
   dynamically and report the association to its peer via PCEP messages.
   If a PCEP speaker does not recognize the ASSOCIATION object, it MUST
   return a PCErr message with Error-Type "Unknown Object" as described
   in [RFC5440].  On receiving a PCEP message with ASSOCIATION, if a
   PCEP speaker finds that too many LSPs belong to the association
   group, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type TBD
   "Association Error" and Error-Value 1 "Too many LSPs in the
   association group".  If a PCEP speaker cannot handle a new
   associations, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type TBD

Internet-Draft            PCE association group                 May 2017


   "Association Error" and Error-Value 2 "Too many association groups".
   These number MAY be set by operator or decided based on a local
   policy.

   If a PCEP speaker receives an association identifier from the
   operator-configuration range, and the association has not been
   configured by the operator, it MUST return a PCErr message with
   Error-Type TBD "Association Error" and Error-Value 3 "Operator-
   configured association missing".  If the association information
   received from the peer does not match with the local operator
   configured information, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-
   Type TBD "Association Error" and Error-Value 4 "Operator-configured
   association information mismatch".  On receiving association
   information that does not match with the association information
   previously received from a peer, it MUST return a PCErr message with
   Error-Type TBD "Association Error" and Error-Value 5 "Association
   information mismatch".  If a PCE peer is unwilling or unable to
   process the ASSOCIATION object, it MUST return a PCErr message with
   the Error-Type "Not supported object" and follow the relevant
   procedures described in [RFC5440].

   The association information is cleared along with the LSP state
   information as per the [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  When a PCEP
   session is terminated, after expiry of State Timeout Interval at PCC,
   the LSP state associated with that PCEP session is reverted to
   operator-defined default parameters or behaviors.  Same procedure is
   also followed for the association information.  On session
   termination at the PCE, when the LSP state reported by PCC is
   cleared, the association information is also cleared.  Where there
   are no LSPs in a association group, the association is considered to
   be deleted.

   In case the LSP is delegated to another PCE on session failure, the
   association information set by the PCE remains intact, unless updated
   by the new PCE.

   Upon LSP delegation revocation, the PCC MAY clear the association
   created by the PCE, but in order to avoid traffic loss, it can
   perform this in a make-before-break fashion, which is the same as
   what is defined in Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] for
   handling LSP state cleanup.

5.1.  PCEP Object

   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "PCEP Objects".
   This document request IANA to allocate the values from this registry.

     Object-Class Value  Name                               Reference

            TBD          Association                        [This I-D]

                         2: IPv6

5.2.  PCEP TLV

   IANA is requested to make the assignment of a new value for the
   existing "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" registry as follows:

               Value     Meaning                     Reference
                TBD      Global Association Source   [This I-D]
                TBD      Extended Association Id     [This I-D]

5.3.  Association Flags

   This document requests IANA to create a subregistry of the "PCEP
   Parameters" for the bits carried in the Flags field of the
   ASSOCIATION object.  The subregistry is called "ASSOCIATION Flags
   Field".

   The field contains 12 bits numbered from bit 0 as the most
   significant bit.

            Bit; Name: Description                  Reference

            15   R: Removal                         [This I-D]

5.4.  PCEP-Error Object

   IANA is requested to allocate new error values within the "PCEP-ERROR
   Object Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the PCEP Numbers
   registry, as follows:

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   apply to the extensions described in this document.  Additional
   considerations related to a malicious PCE are introduced, as the PCE
   may now create additional state on the PCC through the creation of
   association groups.
