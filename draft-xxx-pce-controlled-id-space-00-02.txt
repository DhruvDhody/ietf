                        PCE Controlled ID Space
                  draft-xxx-pce-controlled-id-space-00

Abstract

   In some use cases, such as binding SID and SR path SID allocation, a
   stateful PCE may need to dynamically allocate new labels or Segment
   IDs that come from a PCC's label space.  However, in the existing
   documents, the label range to be used by a PCE is assumed to to be
   known and set on both PCEP peers, so the mechanism of label range
   delegation is required.  This document describes a mechanism to
   advertise specific PCE controlled ID spaces to PCEs via PCEP channel.
   The type of ID can be MPLS label, SRv6 path ID or other ID.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] defines the stateless Path Computation Element
   communication Protocol (PCEP) for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to
   perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients
   (PCCs) requests.  For supporting stateful operations, [RFC8231]
   specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of
   LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].
   Futhermore, [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance, and teardown
   of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need
   for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network that is centrally controlled and deployed.

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE as a central
   controller, examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a

   control protocol in this environment, and introduces the implications
   for the protocol.  Also,
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] specifies the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller, where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and
   label forwarding entries are downloaded through extending PCEP.

   However, these documents do not describe the mechanisms for PCEs to
   manage the space of MPLS label and allocate MPLS label for each of
   the routers that it controls.  The label range to be used by a PCE is
   assumed to be known and set on both PCEP peers
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   For solving this problem, this document describes a mechanism to
   advertise the range of MPLS label, SRv6 path ID
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] via PCEP extensions.  The ID
   space range information can be advertised via the TLVs in the Open
   message.  The detailed procedures will be described in section 4, and
   the objects' format will be introduced in section 5.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5440] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

3.  Use cases

3.1.  Binding SID Allocation

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], the binding SID is
   bound to an SR policy, instantiation of which may involve a list of
   SIDs.  In several scenarios, SR policies need to be dynamically
   updated according to the network status and operation policies.
   Therefore, a PCE needs to obtain the authority to allocate labels
   actively from the PCC's specific label space.

3.2.  Path ID Allocation

   For indicating an SR path, an SR Path Segment and SRv6 path ID are
   defined in [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] and
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] respectively.

   An SR path ID will be allocated dynamically triggered by a SR path
   computation.  A PCE needs to obtain the authority so that it can
   allocate path IDs actively from the PCC's specific path ID space.

4.  Overview of ID delegation

   When a PCEP session is establishing, Open messages will be sent
   between PCCs and PCEs.  Capabilities can be conveied by the
   Capabiliies TLVs in the Open message.  For delegating ID space to a
   stateful PCE, a PCC MUST include ID Space TLVs in Open messages to
   inform the PCE the range of ID space.  This document defines LABEL-
   SPACE-DELEGATION and SRv6-PATH-ID-SPACE-DELEGATION TLVs.

   For delegating multiple types of ID space, multiple ID space TLVs
   will be included in a Open message.  Each type of ID space TLV will
   be included only once in a Open Message.  The ID type can be MPLS
   label, SRv6 path ID [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] or other
   ID.

   The procedure of ID space delegation is shown below:

                       |                                       |

                         Figure 5: ID Delegation Procedures

   If the delegation is successful, the PCE will return a KeepAlive
   message to the PCC.  If there is any error in processing ID
   delegation, an Error (PCErr) message will be sent to the PCC.

   If the PCE can not process ID space delegation TLVs, then the PCE
   should send a PCErr message with Error-type=1 (PCEP session
   establishment failure) and and Error-value=1 (reception of an invalid
   Open message or a non Open message).

   After ID delegation, a stateful PCE can learn the PCE controlled ID
   spaces delegated from PCCs and then it can allocate IDs within the
   delegated ID space actively.  For example, a PCE can actively
   allocate global or local labels/IDs such as binding segments
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] and path ID
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment]
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] according to the delegated ID
   space and the SRGB and SRLB information of a PCC.  SRGB and SRLB

   information of a PCC can be learned from IGP synchronization or other
   ways.  This is out of scope of this document.

5.  Objects

5.1.  Open Object

   For advertising the PCE controlled ID space to a PCE, this document
   defines several TLVs within the Open object.

5.1.1.  LABEL-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV

   For advertising PCE controlled label spaces to a PCE, this document
   defines a LABEL-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV.

   The LABEL-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   object, and its format is shown in the following figure:

   The type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBA.  The length field is a 16 bits
   variable.

   Flags (24 bits):

   o  A-flag: All space flag, set when all the label space is delegated
      to a PCE.  When A-flag is set, the pair of Start and End SHOULD

      NOT appear unless the PCC needs to notify the entire ID space to a
      PCE.

   The rest bits of Flags field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Start n: indicates the beginning of the label block n.

   Range n: indicates the range of the label block n.

   The numbuer of label blocks can be calculated according to value of
   the length filed.

   A stateful PCE can actively allocate labels to an LSP or an SR
   Policy.  For example, binding SIDs [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]
   can be seleted from the delegated label space and then allocated by a
   stateful PCE actively.  Also, Path segment
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] can be allocated by a stateful
   PCE in the same way.

5.1.2.  SRv6-PATH-ID-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV

   For advertising the delegated SRv6 Path ID
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] space to a PCE, this document
   defines an SRv6-PATH-ID-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV.

   The SRv6-PATH-ID-SPACE-DELEGATION TLV is an optional TLV for use in
   the OPEN object, and its format is shown in the following figure:

   The type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBA.  The length field is a 16 bits
   variable.

   Flags (24 bits):

   o  A-flag: All Space flag, set when all the ID space is delegated to
      a PCE.  When A-flag is set, the pair of Start and End SHOULD NOT
      appear unless PCC needs to notify the entire ID space to a PCE.

   The rest bits of Flags field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Start n: indicates the beginning of the SRv6 Path ID block n.

   Range n: indicates the range of the SRv6 Path ID block n.

   The numbuer of ID blocks can be calculated according to the length
   filed.  Given the controlled ID spaces, a stateful PCE can actively
   allocate path IDs to SR paths by selecting from the controlled ID
   spaces.
