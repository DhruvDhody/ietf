<abstract>

<t>This document introduces a mechanism to specify an Segment Routing (SR) policy, as a collection of SR candidate paths. An SR policy is identified by &#60;headend, color, end-point&#62; tuple. An SR policy can contain one or more candidate paths where each candidate path is identified in PCEP via an PLSP-ID. This document proposes extension to PCEP to support association among candidate paths of a given SR policy. The mechanism proposed in this document is applicable to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes of SR.</t>

<t>Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> enables the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture <xref target="RFC4655"/>.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/> describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels.  <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized control of a network.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviors) and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and stateless PCE.</t>

<t>Segment Routing Policy for Traffic Engineering <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> details the concepts of SR Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR Policy.</t>

<t>An SR policy contains one or more candidate paths where one or more such paths can be computed via PCE. This document specifies PCEP extensions to signal additional information to map candidate paths to their SR policies. Each candidate path maps to a unique PLSP-ID in PCEP. By associating multiple candidate paths together, a PCE becomes aware of the hierarchical structure of an SR policy. Thus the PCE can take computation and control decisions about the candidate paths, with the additional knowledge that these candidate paths belong to the same SR policy. This is accomplished via the use of the existing PCEP Association object, by defining a new association type specifically for associating SR candidate paths into a single SR policy.</t>

<t>[Editor's Note- Currently it is assumed that each candidate path has only one ERO (SID-List) within the scope of this document. A future update or another document will deal with a way to allow multiple ERO/SID-Lists for a candidate path within PCEP.]</t>

</section> <!-- Terminology -->

<section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">

<t>The new Association Type (SR Policy Association) and the new TLVs for the ASSOCIATION object, defined in this document, allow a PCEP peer to exchange additional parameters of SR candidate paths and of their parent SR policy. For the SR policy, the parameters are: color and endpoint. For the candidate path, the parameters are: protocol origin, originator, discriminator and preference. <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> describes the concept of SR Policy and these parameters.</t>

<t>The motivation for signaling these parameters is summarized in the following subsections.</t>

<section anchor="Motivation-group" title="Group Candidate Paths belonging to the same SR policy">

<t>Since each candidate path of an SR policy appears as a different LSP (identified via a PLSP-ID) in PCEP, it is useful to group together all the candidate paths that belong to the same SR policy. Furthermore, it is useful for the PCE to have knowledge of the SR candidate path parameters such as color, protocol origin, discriminator, and preference.</t>

</section> <!-- Motivation-group -->

<section anchor="Motivation-candidate-path" title="Instantiation of SR policy candidate paths">

<t>A PCE may want to instantiate one or more candidate paths on the PCC, as specified in <xref target="RFC8281"/>. In this scenario, the PCE needs to signal to a PCC &#60;headend, color, end-point, originator, discriminator, preference&#62; tuple using which the PCC can instantiate a candidate path for the SR policy identified. Current PCEP standards (as of the time of this writing) do not provide a way to signal color and preference. Although end-point can be signaled via the PCEP END-POINTS object, this object may not be suitable because the end-point to which the path is computed is not required to be the same IPv4/IPv6 address as the actual endpoint of the SR policy. Thus, a separate way to specify SR policy's end-point is provided in this document.</t>

</section> <!-- Motivation-candidate-path -->

<section anchor="Motivation-preference" title="Avoid computing lower preference candidate paths">

<t>When a PCE knows that a given set of candidate paths all belong to the same SR policy, then path computation MAY be done on only the highest preference candidate-path(s). Path computation for lower preference paths is not necessary if one or two higher preference paths are already computed. Since computing their paths will not affect traffic steering, it MAY be postponed until the higher preference paths become invalid, thus saving computation resources on the PCE.</t>

</section> <!-- Motivation-preference -->

<section anchor="Motivation-signaling-overhead" title="Minimal signaling overhead">

<t>When an SR policy contains multiple candidate paths computed by a PCE, such candidate paths can be created, updated and deleted independently of each other. This is achieved by making each candidate path correspond to a unique LSP (identified via PLSP-ID). For example, if an SR policy has 4 candidate paths, then if the PCE wants to update one of those candidate paths, only one set of PCUpd and PCRpt messages needs to be exchanged.</t>

</section> <!-- Motivation-signaling-overhead -->

</section> <!-- Motivation -->

<section anchor="Overview" title="Overview">

<t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>, LSPs are placed into an association group. In this document, each LSP corresponds to a candidate path of an SR policy, and the association group corresponds to the SR policy itself. Segment-lists within a candidate path are not represented by different LSPs (and identified via PLSP-IDs).</t> 

<t>[Editor's Note - The subject of encoding multiple segment lists within a candidate path is left to a future document and is not specified in this document. It is not a good idea to have each segment-list correspond to a different LSP/PLSP-ID, because when the PCC wants to get a path, it must know in advance how many multipaths (i.e., segment-lists) there will be and create that many LSPs/PLSP-IDs. For example, if the PCC supports 32 multipaths, then it must delegate 32 LSPs/PLSP-IDs for every candidate path, which may not be scalable.]</t>

<t>A new Association Type is defined in this document, based on the generic ASSOCIATION object. Association type = TBD1 "SR Policy Association Type" for SR Policy Association Group (SRPAG).</t>

<t>The SRPAG Association is only meant to be used for SR LSPs and with PCEP peers which advertise SR capability.</t>

<t>An Association object of SRPAG group contains TLVs that carry Association Information. The association information can be subdivided into three parts: Policy identifiers, Candidate path identifiers, and Candidate path attributes.</t>

<t>Policy Identifiers uniquely identify the SR policy to which a given LSP belongs, within the context of the head-end. Policy Identifiers MUST be the same for all candidate paths in the same SRPAG. Policy Identifiers MUST NOT change for a given LSP during its lifetime. Policy Identifiers MUST be different for different SRPAG associations. When these rules are not satisfied, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error Code = 26 "Association Error", Error Type = TBD5 "Conflicting SRPAG TLV". Policy Identifiers consist of:</t>
<t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Color of SR policy.</t>
        <t>End-point of SR policy.</t>
      </list>
</t>

<t>Candidate Path Identifiers uniquely identify the SR candidate path within the context of an SR policy. Candidate path Identifiers MUST NOT change for a given LSP during its lifetime. Candidate path Identifiers MUST be different for different LSPs within the same SRPAG. When these rules are not satisfied, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error Code = 26 "Association Error", Error Type = TBD5 "Conflicting SRPAG TLV". Candidate path Identifiers consist of:</t>
<t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Protocol Origin of candidate path.</t>
        <t>Originator of candidate path.</t>
        <t>Discriminator of candidate path.</t>
      </list>
</t>

<t>Candidate Path Attributes MUST NOT be used to identify the candidate path. Candidate path attributes carry additional information about the candidate path and MAY change during the lifetime of the LSP. Candidate path Attributes consist of:</t>
<t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Preference of candidate path.</t>
      </list>
</t>
<t>As described in <xref target="RFC8231"/>, an LSP is uniquely identified in PCEP via PLSP-ID.</t>

<t>A mapping between the Association Parameters (see <xref target="Terminology"/>) and Policy Identifiers (the Color and End-point) needs to be maintained. The mapping is left up to the implementation. An implementation MAY choose Association Parameters in such a way that every possible Color and End-point maps to a unique value of Association Parameters, which may require the use of Extended Association ID TLV. Alternatively, an implementation MAY implement a lookup table to generate Association Parameters incrementally as new Color and End-point values are created, which may not require the use of Extended Association ID TLV.</t> 

<t>As per the processing rules specified in section 5.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>, if a PCEP speaker does not support the SRPAG association type, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 (Early allocation by IANA) "Association Error" and Error-Value 1 "Association-type is not supported". Please note that the corresponding PCEP session is not reset.</t>

</section> <!-- Overview -->

<section anchor="Association" title="SR Policy Association Group">

<t>Two ASSOCIATION object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>. The ASSOCIATION object includes "Association type" indicating the type of the association group. This document adds a new Association type.</t>

<t>Association type = TBD1 "SR Policy Association Type" for SR Policy Association Group (SRPAG).</t>

<t>The operator configured Association Range SHOULD NOT be set for this association type and MUST be ignored.</t>

<t>SRPAG MUST carry additional TLVs to communicate Association Information. This document specifies three new TLVs to carry Association Information: SRPAG-POL-ID-TLV, SRPAG-CPATH-ID-TLV, SRPAG-CPATH-ATTR-TLV. These three TLVs encode the Policy Identifiers, Candidate path Identifiers and Candidate path Attributes, respectively. When any of the mandatory TLVs are missing from the SRPAG association object, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error Code = 26 "Association Error", Error Type = TBD6 "Missing mandatory SRPAG TLV".</t>

<t>A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPAG, since a candidate path cannot belong to multiple SR policies. If a PCEP speaker receives a PCEP message with more than one SRPAG for an LSP, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error-Value TBD7 "Multiple SRPAG for one LSP". If the message is a PCRpt message, then the PCEP speaker MUST close the PCEP connection. Closing the PCEP connection is necessary because ignoring PCRpt messages may lead to inconsistent LSP DB state between the two PCEP peers.</t>

<t>If the PCEP speaker receives the SRPAG association when the SR capability (as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> or <xref target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/>) was not exchanged, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error-Value TBD8 "Use of SRPAG without SR capability exchange".
  If the Path Setup Type (PST) of the LSP in SRPAG is not set to SR or SRv6, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error-Value TBD9 "non-SR LSP in SRPAG".</t>

<t>PCRpt and PCUpd messages are exchanged in the following sequence:</t>

<t>
      <list style="numbers">

        <t>Step 1: For each candidate path of the SR policy, the PCC generates a different PLSP-ID and symbolic-name and sends multiple PCRpt messages (or one message with multiple LSP objects) to the PCE. Each LSP object is followed by SRPAG ASSOCIATION object with identical Color and Endpoint values.</t>

        <t>Step 2: PCE takes into account that all the LSPs belong to the same SR policy. PCE prioritizes computation for the highest preference LSP and sends PCUpd message(s) back to the PCC.</t>

        <t>Step 3: If a new candidate path is added on the PCC by the operator, then a new PLSP-ID and symbolic name is generated for that candidate path and a new PCRpt is sent to the PCE.</t>

        <t>Step 4: If an existing candidate path is removed from the PCC by the operator, then that PLSP-ID is deleted from the PCE by sending PCRpt with the R-flag in the LSP object set.</t>

<t>A candidate-path is created using the following steps:</t>

<t>
      <list style="numbers">

        <t>PCE sends PCInitiate message, as usual containing the SRPAG Association object. PCE needs to generate a symbolic-name for this LSP that will not clash with other symbolic names on the same PCC.</t>

        <t>PCC uses the color, endpoint and preference from the SRPAG object to create a new candidate path. If no SR policy exists to hold the candidate path, then a new SR policy is created to hold the new candidate-path. The Originator of the candidate path is set to be the address of the PCE that is sending the PCInitiate message.</t>
        
        <t>PCC allocates a locally unique PLSP-ID for the newly created candidate path. This PLSP-ID is sent to the PCE in the PCRpt message.</t>

<section  title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document defines one new type for association, which do not add any new
      security concerns beyond those discussed in <xref target="RFC5440"/>,
      <xref target='RFC8231'/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>, <xref target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> and <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> in itself.
      </t>
     <t>The information carried in the SRPAG Association object, as per this document is related to SR Policy. 
      It often reflects information
    that can also be derived from the SR Database, but association provides a much easier grouping of related LSPs and messages. The SRPAG association could provides an adversary with the opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship between the LSPs.  Thus securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8253"/>, as per the recommendations and
   best current practices in <xref target="RFC7525"/>, is RECOMMENDED.</t>
