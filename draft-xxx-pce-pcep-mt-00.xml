    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP enables the communication between a Path Computation
      Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE,
      for the purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
      Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.
      </t>

      <t><xref target='RFC8231'></xref>  specifies a
      set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
      control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
      <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing
   and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in
      <xref target='RFC8281'></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>Some protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, allow a single
   network to be viewed as multiple topologies <xref target='RFC4915'></xref> <xref target='RFC5120'></xref>.
   Deploying multi-topology (MT) routing allows different paths through
   the network to be selected to support different traffic or to offer
   protection paths in the event of failures. A 16-bit Multi-Topology identifier (MT-ID) is used to identify the topology.</t>

   <t>This document extends PCEP to allow MT-ID to be encoded in the PCEP messages.</t>

   <section title="Applicability to Enhanced VPN (VPN+)" toc="default">
   <t>The framework for an enhanced virtual private network (VPN+) is
   described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn'/>. Driven 
   largely by needs arising from the 5G mobile network design,
   the concept of network slicing has gained traction.  There is a need
   to create a VPN service with enhanced isolation and performance
   characteristics.  Specifically, there is a need for a transport
   network to support a set of virtual networks, each of which provides
   the client with some dedicated (private) network resources drawn from
   a shared pool.  The tenant of such a virtual network can require a
   degree of isolation and performance that previously could only be
   satisfied by dedicated networks.  Additionally the tenant may ask for
   some level of control of their virtual networks e.g. to customize the
   service paths in their network slices.</t>

   <t>These properties cannot be met with pure overlay networks, as they
   require tighter coordination and integration between the underlay and
   the overlay network.  <xref target='I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn'/> provides the
   framework of enhanced VPN and describes the candidate component
   technologies.  <xref target='I-D.dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn'/> describes how
   segment routing (SR) <xref target='RFC8402'/> is used to
   construct the required virtual networks with the network resources
   allocated for enhanced VPN services.</t>

   <t>The Multi-Topology (MT) extension to PCEP as 
   described in this document can also be used for he construction of 
   virtual networks for enhanced VPN services, together with the segment
   routing.</t>

  <t>A new MT object is defined to indicate the MT-ID. The MT object MAY be carried within PCReq to indicate that the path computation needs to be carried on the topology identified by the MT-ID.

   give an attacker sensitive information about the operations of the
   network.  Thus, such deployment should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925"/> or
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8253"/>.  The procedure based on TLS
