	<abstract>
   <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of 
    a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands. PCE was developed to 
   derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).</t>

   <t>SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing (SR), Service Function
   Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network.  It
   is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for
   use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a
   central controller.</t>

   <t>This document describes
   general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its
   applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and
   limitations, through a number of use cases. 
   PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage are
   covered in separate documents.</t>

  <section title="Application Scenarios">
  <t>In the following sections, several use cases are described,
   showcasing scenarios that benefit from the deployment of 
   PCECC.</t>



	<section title="Use Cases of PCECC for Label Management" anchor="section-3">
    <t>As per <xref target="RFC8283"/>, in some cases, the PCE-based controller can take responsibility for
   managing some part of the MPLS label space for each of the routers
   that it controls, and it may taker wider responsibility for
   partitioning the label space for each router and allocating different
   parts for different uses, communicating the ranges to the router
   using PCEP.</t>
   <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/> describe a mode
   where LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop
   on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told what
   label forwarding instructions to program and what resources to
   reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP.  For this to work, the PCE-
   based controller will take responsibility for managing some part of
   the MPLS label space for each of the routers that it controls. 
   An extension to PCEP could be done to allow a PCC to
   inform the PCE of such a label space to control.</t>

   <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to PCEP that
   allow a stateful PCE to compute, update or initiate SR-TE paths.
   <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/> describes the
   mechanism for PCECC to allocate and provision the node/prefix/
   adjacency label (SID) via PCEP.  To make such allocation PCE needs to
   be aware of the label space from Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB)
   or Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB)
   <xref target="RFC8402"/> of the node that it controls.  A
   mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of such a label space to
   control is needed within PCEP.  The full SRGB/SRLB of a node could be
   learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism too.</t>

   <t><xref target="I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space"/> defines a PCEP extension to support
   advertisement of the MPLS label space to the PCE to control.</t>

   <t>There have been various proposals for Global Labels, the PCECC 
    architecture could be used as means to learn the label space of nodes, and could also be used to
	determine and provision the global label range.</t>

	<!--<t>
   This use case is based on network configuration illustrated using
   the following figure:</t>-->

	<section title="Using PCECC for SR" anchor="section-4">
    <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Using
   SR, a source node steers a packet through a path without relying on
   hop-by-hop signaling protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is
   specified as an ordered list of instructions called "segments".  Each
   segment is an instruction to route the packet to a specific place in
   the network, or to perform a specific service on the packet.  A
   database of segments can be distributed through the network using a
   routing protocol (such as IS-IS or OSPF) or by any other means. 
   PCEP (and PCECC) could be one such means.</t>

   <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specify the
   SR specific PCEP extensions. PCECC may further use PCEP protocol 
   for SR SID (Segment Identifier)
   distribution to the SR nodes (PCC) with some benefits. If the
   PCECC allocates and maintains the SID in the network for the nodes and adjacencies; 
   and further distributes them to the SR nodes directly via the
   PCEP session has some advantage over the configurations on 
   each SR node and flooding via IGP, especially in a SDN environment. </t>


   <!--<t>
   For the centralized network, the performance achieved through
   distributed system can not be easy matched if all of the forwarding
   path is computed, downloaded and maintained by the centralized
   controller.  The performance can be improved by supporting part of
   the forwarding path in the PCECC network through the segment routing
   mechanism except that node segment ids and adjacency segment IDs for
   all the network are allocated dynamically and propagated through the
   centralized controller instead of using the IGP extension.</t>-->

	<t>
   When the PCECC is used for the distribution of the node segment ID
   and adjacency segment ID, the node segment ID is allocated from the
   SRGB of the node.  For the allocation of adjacency segment ID, the 
   allocation is from the SRLB of the node as described in <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>.</t>

	 <t><xref target="RFC8355"/> identifies various protection and resiliency usecases for SR. 
   Path protection lets the ingress node be in charge of the failure
   recovery (used for SR-TE). Also protection can be
   performed by the node adjacent to the failed component, commonly
   referred to as local protection techniques or fast-reroute (FRR) techniques.
   In case of PCECC, the protection paths can be pre-computed
   and setup by the PCE.</t>

	<t>
   The following example illustrate the use case where the node SID and adjacency SID are allocated by the PCECC.</t>

  <section title="PCECC SID Allocation" >
   
   <t>Each node (PCC) is allocated a node-SID by the PCECC. The PCECC
   needs to update the label map of each node to all
   the nodes in the domain.  On receiving the label map, each node (PCC) uses the local
   routing information to determine the next-hop and download the label
   forwarding instructions accordingly. The forwarding behavior and the end result 
   is same as IGP based Node-SID in SR.  Thus, from anywhere in the domain, it enforces the
   ECMP-aware shortest-path forwarding of the packet towards the related
   node.</t>     

   <t>For each adjacency in the network, PCECC can allocate an Adj-SID. The PCECC sends
   PCInitiate message to update the label map of each Adj to the
   corresponding nodes in the domain.  Each node (PCC) download the
   label forwarding instructions accordingly. The forwarding behavior and the end result is similar to IGP based
   "Adj-SID" in SR.</t>

   <t>The various mechanism are described in <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>.</t>     
  </section>
	<section title="Use Cases of PCECC for SR Best Effort (BE) Path" anchor="section-4.1"><t>
   In this mode of the solution, the PCECC just need to allocate the
   node segment ID and adjacency ID (without calculating the explicit
   path for the SR path).  The ingress of the forwarding path just need
   to encapsulate the destination node segment ID on top of the packet.
   All the intermediate nodes will forward the packet based on the 
   destination node SID.  It is similar to the LDP LSP.</t>



	<!--<t>
   The SR BE path examples are explained as below:</t>

	<t>
   Example 1:</t>-->

	
   <t>R1 may send a packet to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008} (Node SID for R8). The path would be the based on the routing/nexthop calculation on the routers.</t>

	<!--<t>
   Example 2: local link/node protection:</t>

	<t>
   For the packet which has destination of R3 and after that, R2 may
   preinstalled the backup forwarding entry to protect the R4 node, the
   pre-installed the backup path can go through either node5 or link1 or
   link2 between R2 and R3.  The backup path calculation is locally
   decided by R2 and any existing IP FRR algorithms can be used here.</t>-->

	</section>

	<section title="Use Cases of PCECC for SR Traffic Engineering (TE) Path" anchor="section-4.2">
   <t>SR-TE paths may not follow an IGP SPT.  Such paths
   may be chosen by a PCECC and provisioned on
   the ingress node of the SR-TE path. The SR header consists of a list of
   SIDs (or MPLS labels).  The header
   has all necessary information so that, the packets can be guided from
   the ingress node to the egress node of the path; hence, there is no
   need for any signaling protocol. 
   For the case where strict traffic engineering path is needed, all the
   adjacency SID are stacked, otherwise a combination of node-SID or adj-SID can be used for the SR-TE paths.</t>

	<t>
   Note that the bandwidth reservations is only guaranteed at controller and through the enforce of
   the bandwidth admission control.  As for the RSVP-TE LSP case, the control plane signaling also does the link bandwidth reservation in each hop of the
   path.</t>

	<t>
   The SR traffic engineering path examples are explained as bellow:</t>

	<t>
   Note that the node SID for each node is allocated from the
   SRGB and adjacency SID
   for each link are allocated from the SRLB for each
   node.</t>

	<t>
   Example 1:</t>

	<t>
   R1 may send a packet P1 to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008}.  Based on the best path, it could be: R1-R2-R3-R8.</t>

	<t>
   Example 2:</t>

	<t>
   R1 may send a packet P2 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
   list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-link1-R3-R8.</t>

	<t>
   Example 3:</t>

	<t>
   R1 may send a packet P3 to R8 via R4 by pushing an SR header with segment list {1004, 1008}.  The path
   could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8</t>

	<t>
   The local protection examples for SR TE path are explained 
   below:</t>

	<t>
   Example 4: local link protection:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols">
    <t>R1 may send a packet P4 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-link1-R3-R8.</t>

	<t>When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      link1-R3-R8, and also find out there is a link failure of
      link1, then the R2 can enforce the traffic over the bypass to send out the packet with header of R3-R8
      through link2.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   Example 5: local node protection:

	<list style="symbols">
<t>R1 may send a packet P5 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
   list {1004, 1008}.  The path could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8.</t>

<t>When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
   {1004, 1008}, and also finds out there is a node failure for node4,
   then it can enforce the traffic over the bypass and send out the packet with header of {1005, 1008} to
   node5 instead of node4.</t>

	<section title="Use Cases of PCECC for TE LSP" anchor="section-5"><t>
   In the <xref target="section-4"/> the case of SR
   path via PCECC is discussed.  Although those cases give the
   simplicity and scalability, but there are existing functionalities
   for the traffic engineering path such as the bandwidth guarantee, monitoring
   where SR based solution are complex.  Also there are cases where the
   depth of the label stack is an issue for existing
   deployment and certain vendors.</t>

   <t> 
   So to address these issues, PCECC architecture also support
   the TE LSP functionalities.  To achieve this, the
   existing PCEP can be used to communicate between the PCECC and
   nodes along the path. This is similar to static LSPs, where LSPs
   can be provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop on the
   end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told what label-
   forwarding instructions to program and what resources to reserve.
   The PCE-based controller keeps a view of the network and determines
   the paths of the end-to-end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to
   communicate with each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.</t>

<t>Based on path computation request / delegation or PCE initiation, the PCECC

   This MBH architecture uses L2 access rings and sub-rings. L3 starts at
   the aggregation layer. For the sake of simplicity, the figure shows only one access
   sub-ring, access ring and aggregation ring (AGG1...AGGN), connected
   by Nx10GE interfaces. Aggregation domain runs its own IGP. There are
   two Egress routers (AGG N-1,AGG N) that are connected to the Core
   domain via L2 interfaces. Core also have connections to service routers,
   RSVP-TEs are used for MPLS transport inside the ring. There could be
   at least 2 tunnels (one way) from each AGG router to egress AGG
   routers. There are also many L2 access rings connected to AGG routers.</t>

	<t>
   Service deployment made by means of either L2VPNs (VPLS) or L3VPNs.
   Those services use MPLS TE as transport towards egress AGG routers.
   TE tunnels could be also used as transport towards service routers in
   case of seamless MPLS based architecture in the future.</t>

  <t>There is a need to solve the following tasks: 
  <list style="symbols">

	<t>Perform automatic  load-balance amongst TE tunnels according to current
       traffic load.</t>
	<t>TE bandwidth (BW) management: Provide guaranteed BW for specific
       service: HSI, IPTV, etc., provide time-based BW reservation (BoD) for other services.</t>
  <t>Simplify development of TE tunnels by automation without any manual intervention.</t>
  
	<t>Provide flexibility for Service Router placement (anywhere
       in the network by creation of  transport LSPs to them).</t>
  </list></t>
	<t>Since other tasks are already considered by other PCECC use cases,
	in this section, the focus is on load balancing (LB) task. LB task
   could be solved by means of PCECC in the following way:
	<list style="symbols">
    <t>After application or network service or operator can ask SDN
       controller (PCECC) for LSP based LB between AGG X and AGG N/AGG N-1
       (egress AGG routers which have connections to core) via North
       Bound Interface (NBI). Each of these would have associated 
       constrains (i.e. Path Setup Type (PST), bandwidth, inclusion or exclusion specific links
       or nodes, number of paths, objective function (OF), need
       for disjoint LSP paths etc.).</t>

	<t>PCECC could calculate multiple (Say N) LSPs according to given constrains,
       calculation is based on results of Objective Function (OF) <xref target="RFC5541"/>, constraints, endpoints, same or different
       bandwidth (BW) , different links (in case of disjoint paths) and other
       constrains.</t>

	<t>Depending on given LSP Path setup type (PST), PCECC would use download 
    instructions to the PCC. At this stage it is assumed the PCECC is aware 
    of the label space it controls and in case of SR the SID allocation and 
    distribution is already done.</t>

	<t>PCECC would send PCInitiate PCEP message <xref target="RFC8281"/> towards ingress AGG X router(PCC) for each of N LSPs
       and receives PCRpt PCEP message <xref target="RFC8231"/> back from
       PCCs. If the PST is PCECC-SR, the PCECC would include the SID stack as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>. 
       If the PST is PCECC (basic), then the PCECC would assigns labels along the calculated path; and set up the
   path by sending central controller instructions in PCEP message to each node along the path of the
   LSP as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/> and then
       send PCUpd message to the ingress AGG X router with
       information about new LSP and AGG X(PCC) would respond with PCRpt
       with LSP status.</t>

		<t>AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG N-1
       which are available for installing to router's forwarding and LB of traffic
       between them. Traffic distribution between those LSPs depends on
       particular realization of hash-function on that router.</t>

	<t>Since PCECC is aware of TEDB (TE state) and LSP-DB, it  can manage and
       prevent possible over-subscriptions and limit number of available LB
       states. Via PCECC mechanism the control can take quick actions into 
       the network by directly provisioning the central control instructions.</t>

   ASes if the scalability and performance are enough. The PCE would require
   interfaces (PCEP and BGP-LS) to both domains. PCECC redundancy

   In a case of PCECC Inter-AS TE scenario where service provider
   controls both domains (AS1 and AS2), each of them have own IGP and MPLS
   transport. There is a need is to setup Inter-AS LSPs for transporting different
   services on top of them (Voice, L3VPN etc.). Inter-AS links with different
   capacity exist in several regions. The task is not only to provision
   those Inter-AS LSPs with given constrains but also calculate the path
   and pre-setup the backup Inter-AS LSPs that will be used if primary LSP fails.</t>

	<t>
   As per the <xref target="fig_inter_as_pce"/>,  LSP1 from R1 to R3 goes via ASBR1
   and ASBR3, and it is the primary Inter-AS LSP. R1-R3 LSP2 that go via
   ASBR5 and ASBR6 is the backup one. In addition there could also be a bypass LSP
   setup to protect against ASBR or inter-AS link failure.</t>

   After the addition of PCECC functionality to PCE (SDN controller), PCECC
   based Inter-AS TE model SHOULD follow as PCECC usecase for TE LSP 
   as requirements of <xref target="RFC5376"/> with the following details:

	<list style="symbols">
	<t>Since PCECC needs to know the topology of both domains AS1 and AS2, PCECC
       could use BGP-LS peering with routers (or RRs) in both domains.</t>

	<t>PCECC needs to PCEP connectivity towards all routers in both
       domains (see also section 4 in <xref target="RFC5376"/>) in a similar manner as a SDN controller.</t>

	<t>After operator's application or service orchestrator will create request
       for tunnel creation of specific service, PCECC should receive that request via NBI
       (NBI type is implementation dependent, could be NETCONF/Yang, REST etc.). Then
       PCECC would calculate the optimal path based on Objective Function (OF) and given
       constraints (i.e. path setup type, bandwidth etc.), including those from <xref target="RFC5376"/>:
       priority, AS sequence, preferred ASBR, disjoint paths, protection. On this
       step we would have two paths: R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3</t>

	<t>Depending on given LSP PST (PCECC or PCECC-SR), PCECC would use central control download 
    instructions to the PCC. At this stage it is assumed the PCECC is aware 
    of the label space it controls and in case of SR the SID allocation and 
    distribution is already done.</t>

  <t>PCECC would send PCInitiate PCEP message <xref target="RFC8281"/> towards ingress router R1 (PCC) in AS1
       and receives PCRpt PCEP message <xref target="RFC8231"/> back from
       PCC. If the PST is PCECC-SR, the PCECC would include the SID stack as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>.
       It may also include binding SID based on AS boundary. The backup SID stack could also be installed at ingress but more importantly 
       each node along the SR path could also do local protection just based on the top segment. 
       If the PST is PCECC (basic), then the PCECC would assigns labels along the calculated paths (R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3); and set up the
   path by sending central controller instructions in PCEP message to each node along the path of the
   LSPs as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/> and then
       send PCUpd message to the ingress R1 router with
       information about new LSPs and R1 would respond with PCRpt
       with LSP(s) status.</t>

    <!--<t>AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG N-1
       which are available for installing to router's forwarding and LB of traffic
       between them. Traffic distribution between those LSPs depends on
       particular realization of hash-function on that router.</t>-->

	<t>After that step R1 now have primary and backup TEs (LSP1 and LSP2) towards
       R3. It is up to router implementation how to 
       make switchover to backup LSP2 if LSP1 fails.</t>

   The current multicast LSPs are setup either using the RSVP-TE P2MP or

   manual configurations and complex signaling when the
   protection is considered.  By using the PCECC solution, the multicast
   LSP can be computed and setup through centralized controller which
   has the full picture of the topology and bandwidth usage for each
   link.  It not only reduces the complex configurations comparing the

   An end-to-end protection principle can be

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast tree

	<section title="Use Cases of PCECC for LSP in the Network Migration" anchor="section-7"><t>
   One of the main advantages for PCECC solution is that it has backward
   compatibility naturally since the PCE server itself can function as a
   proxy node of MPLS network for all the new nodes which may no longer support
   the signaling protocols.</t>

	<t>
   As it is illustrated in the following example, the current network
   could migrate to a total PCECC controlled network gradually by
   replacing the legacy nodes.  During the migration, the legacy nodes
   still need to signal using the existing MPLS protocol such as LDP and
   RSVP-TE, and the new nodes setup their portion of the forwarding path
   through PCECC directly.  With the PCECC function as the proxy of
   these new nodes, MPLS signaling can populate through network as
   normal.</t>

   Delivering services over a network in an optimal way requires

   routing (where it is used to select which set of forwarding
   instructions to add to a packet); and SFC (where it indicates along
   which service function path a packet should be forwarded).  In
   conjunction with traffic engineering, traffic classification is an
   important enabler for load balancing. Traffic classification is closely linked to the computational
   elements of planning for the network functions just listed because it
   determines how traffic load is balanced and distributed through the
   network.  Therefore, selecting what traffic classification should be
   performed by a router is an important part of the work done by a
   PCECC.</t>

   <t>Instructions can be passed from the controller to the routers using
   PCEP.  These instructions tell the routers how to map traffic to
   paths or connections. Refer <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec"/>.</t>

    <t>
   Along with traffic classification, there are few more question that needs to be considered once the path is setup -

  <section title="Use Cases of PCECC for SRv6" >
    <t>As per <xref target="RFC8402"/>, with Segment Routing (SR),
   a node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called segments.  Segment Routing
   can be applied to the IPv6 architecture with the Segment Routing
   Header (SRH) <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>.  A segment is
   encoded as an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded
   as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The
   active segment is indicated by the Destination Address of the packet.
   Upon completion of a segment, a pointer in the new routing header is
   incremented and indicates the next segment.</t>

   <t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>, an SRv6 Segment is a
   128-bit value.  "SRv6 SID" or simply "SID" are often used as a
   shorter reference for "SRv6 Segment".  Further details are in An
   illustration is provided in
   <xref target="I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming"/> where SRv6 SID is represented as LOC:FUNCT.</t>

   <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> extends
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> to support SR for IPv6 data plane. Further
   a PCECC could be extended to support SRv6 SID allocation and distribution.</t>

  <t>In this case, PCECC could assign the SRv6 SID (in form of a IPv6 address) to be used for node and adjacency. Later SRv6 path in form of list of SRv6 SID could be used at the ingress. Some examples - 
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>SRv6 SID-List={2001:db8::8} - The best path towards R8</t>
      <t>SRv6 SID-List={2001:db8::5, 2001:db8::8} - The path towards R8 via R5</t>

  <section title="Use Cases of PCECC for SFC" >
    <t>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is described in <xref target="RFC7665"/>.  It is the process of directing
   traffic in a network such that it passes through specific hardware
   devices or virtual machines (known as service function nodes) that
   can perform particular desired functions on the traffic.  The set of
   functions to be performed and the order in which they are to be
   performed is known as a service function chain.  The chain is
   enhanced with the locations at which the service functions are to be
   performed to derive a Service Function Path (SFP).  Each packet is
   marked as belonging to a specific SFP, and that marking lets each
   successive service function node know which functions to perform and
   to which service function node to send the packet next. To operate an SFC network, the service function nodes must be
   configured to understand the packet markings, and the edge nodes must
   be told how to mark packets entering the network.  Additionally, it
   may be necessary to establish tunnels between service function nodes
   to carry the traffic. Planning an SFC network requires load balancing between service
   function nodes and traffic engineering across the network that
   connects them.  As per <xref target="RFC8283"/>, these are operations that can be performed by a
   PCE-based controller, and that controller can use PCEP to program the
   network and install the service function chains and any required
   tunnels.</t>
   <t>PCECC can play the role for setting the traffic classification rules at the classifier as well as downloading the forwarding instructions to the SFFs so that they could process the NSH and forward accordingly.</t>

  <section title="Use Cases of PCECC for Native IP" >
    <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-native-ip-scenarios"/> describes the scenarios, and suggestions for
   the "Centrally Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR)" architecture, which
   integrates the merit of traditional distributed protocols (IGP/BGP),
   and the power of centrally control technologies (PCE/SDN) to provide
   one feasible traffic engineering solution in various complex
   scenarios for the service provider. <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-pce-native-ip"/> defines the framework for CCDR traffic engineering
   within Native IP network, using Dual/Multi-BGP session strategy and
   CCDR architecture. PCEP protocol can be used to transfer
   the key parameters between PCE and the underlying network
   devices (PCC) using PCECC technique. The central control instructions from PCECC to identify which prefix should be advertised on which BGP session.</t> 
   
  </section>  
  <section title="Use Cases of PCECC for Local Protection (RSVP-TE)">
    <t><xref target="I-D.cbrt-pce-stateful-local-protection"/> describes the need for the PCE to maintain and associate the local protection paths for the RSVP-TE LSP. 
   Local protection requires the setup of a bypass at the PLR.  This
   bypass can be PCC-initiated and delegated, or PCE-initiated.  In
   either case, the PLR MUST maintain a PCEP session to the PCE. The Bypass LSPs 
   need to mapped to the primary LSP. This could be done locally at the PLR based on a local policy 
   but there is a need for a PCE to do the mapping as well to exert greater control. </t>

   <t>This mapping can be done via PCECC procedures where the PCE could instruct the PLR to the mapping and 
    identify the primary LSP for which bypass should be used.

  </section>
  <section title="Use Cases of PCECC for BIER" >
   <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) <xref target="RFC8279"/> defines an
   architecture where all intended multicast receivers are encoded as a
   bitmask in the multicast packet header within different
   encapsulations.  A router that
   receives such a packet will forward the packet based on the bit
   position in the packet header towards the receiver(s) following a
   precomputed tree for each of the bits in the packet.  Each receiver
   is represented by a unique bit in the bitmask.</t>

   <t>BIER-TE <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch"/> shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER.  BIER-TE forwards
   and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but
   every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one
   or more adjacencies. BIER-TE
   Path can be derived from a PCE and used at the ingress as described in <xref target="I-D.chen-pce-bier"/>.</t>

   <t>Further, PCECC mechanims could be used for the allocation of bits for the BIER router for BIER as well as for the adjacencies for BIER-TE. PCECC based controller 
   	can use PCEP to instruct the BIER capable routers the meaning of the bits as well as other fields needed for BIER encapsulation.</t>

  <section title="Using reliable P2MP TE based multicast delivery for distributed computations (MapReduce-Hadoop)" anchor="section-6.3">
   <t>
   MapReduce model of distributed computations in computing clusters is
   widely deployed. In <eref target="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</eref> 1.0 architecture MapReduce operations on
   big data performs by means of Master-Slave architecture in the Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS), where NameNode has the knowledge about
   resources of the cluster and where actual data (chunks) for particular
   task are located (which DataNode). Each chunk of data (64MB or more)
   should have 3 saved copies in different DataNodes based on their
   proximity.</t>

  <t>
   Proximity level currently has semi-manual allocation and based on
   Rack IDs (Assumption is that closer data are better because of access
   speed/smaller latency).</t>

  <t>
   JobTracker node is responsible for computation tasks, scheduling across
   DataNodes and also have Rack-awareness. Currently transport protocols
   between NameNode/JobTracker and DataNodes are based on IP unicast.
   It has simplicity as pros but has numerous drawbacks related with
   its flat approach.</t>

  <t>
   It is clear that we should go beyond of one DC for Hadoop cluster creation
   and move towards distributed clusters. In that case we need to handle
   performance and latency issues.
   Latency depends on speed of light in fiber links and also latency
   introduced by intermediate devices in between. The last one is
   closely correlated with network device architecture and performance.
   Current performance of NPU based routers should be enough for creating
   distribute Hadoop clusters with predicted latency. Performance of SW
   based routers (mainly as VNF) together with additional HW features such
   as DPDK are promising but require additional research and testing.</t>

  <t>
   Main question is how can we create simple but effective architecture for
   distributed Hadoop cluster?</t>

  <t>
   There is research <xref target="MAP-REDUCE"/> which show
   how usage of multicast tree could improve speed of resource or cluster
   members discovery inside the cluster as well as increase redundancy in
   communications between cluster nodes.</t>

  <t>
   Is traditional IP based multicast enough for that? We doubt it because it
   requires additional control plane (IGMP, PIM) and a lot of signaling, that
   is not suitable for high performance computations, that are very sensitive
   to latency.</t>

  <t>
   P2MP TE tunnels looks much more suitable as potential solution for creation
   of multicast based communications between Master and Slave nodes inside
   cluster. Obviously these P2MP tunnels should be dynamically created and
   turned down (no manual intervention). Here, the PCECC comes to play with
    main objective to create optimal topology of each particular request for
   MapReduce computation and also create P2MP tunnels with needed parameters
   such as bandwidth and delay.</t>

  <t>
   This solution would require to use MPLS label based forwarding inside the
   cluster. Usage of label based forwarding inside DC was proposed by Yandex
   <xref target="MPLS-DC"/>. Technically it is already possible because MPLS on switches
   is already supported by some vendors, MPLS also exists on Linux and OVS.</t>

  <t>
   Communication between Master nodes (JobTracker and NameNode)
   and PCECC via REST API MAY be either done directly or via
   cluster manager such as Mesos.</t>

  <t>
   Phase 1: Distributed cluster resources discovery
   During this phase Master Nodes SHOULD identify and find available
   Slave nodes according to computing request from application (APP).
   NameNode SHOULD query PCECC about available DataNodes, NameNode MAY
   provide additional constrains to PCECC such as topological proximity,
   redundancy level.</t>

  <t>
   PCECC SHOULD analyze the topology of distributed cluster and perform
   constrain based path calculation from client towards most
   suitable NameNodes. PCECC SHOULD reply to NameNode the list of most
   suitable DataNodes and their resource capabilities. Topology discovery
   mechanism for PCECC will be added later to that framework.</t>

  <t>
   Phase 2: PCECC SHOULD create P2MP LSP from client towards those
   DataNodes by means of PCEP messages following previously calculated path.</t>

  
  <t>Phase 3. NameNode SHOULD send this information to client, PCECC informs
  client about optimal P2MP path towards DataNodes via PCEP message.
  </t>

  
  <t>
   Phase 4. Client sends data blocks to those DataNodes for writing via
   created P2MP tunnel.</t>

  <t>
   When this task will be finished, P2MP tunnel could be turned down.</t>
