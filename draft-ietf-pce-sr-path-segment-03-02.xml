    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
      functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</t>

      <t>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture
      describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through
      an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm. A Segment
      Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an
      IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path
      Computation Element (PCE).</t>

      <t>Path identification is needed for several use cases such as
      performance measurement in Segment Routing (SR) network. This document
      specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication
      Protocol (PCEP) to support requesting, replying, reporting and updating
      the Path Segment ID (Path SID) between PCEP speakers.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
      purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE
      LSP) characteristics.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
      enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
      compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to
      effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref
      target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/>
      specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as
      the central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as
      explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.</t>

      <t>Segment routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402"/> leverages the source
      routing and tunneling paradigms and supports steering packets into an
      explicit forwarding path at the ingress node.</t>

      <t>An SR path needs to be identified in some use cases such as
      performance measurement. In order to identify an SR path, SR-MPLS Path
      Segment is identified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/> while the SRv6 Path Segment
      is identified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-path-segment"/>.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8664"/> specifies extensions to the Path Computation
      Element Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> for SR networks, that
      allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate SR-TE paths, as well as a
      PCC to request, report or delegate SR paths.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>
      specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions when a PCE-based
      controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on
      the routers (SR SID distribution in this case), in addition to computing
      the paths for packet flows in a segment routing network and telling the
      edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the
      network.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to carry the SR path
      identification information in PCEP messages <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      <xref target="RFC8231"/> <xref target="RFC8281"/>. The SR path
      identifier can be a Path Segment in SR-MPLS <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/> and SRv6 <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-path-segment"/>, or other IDs that can
      identify an SR path. This document also extends the PCECC-SR mechanism
      to inform the Path Segment to the egress PCC.</t>

    <section title="Overview of Path Segment Extensions in PCEP">
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism of allocating Path Segment and
      extends PCEP to encode it in PCEP messages. For supporting Path Segment
      in PCEP, several TLVs and flags are defined. The formats of the objects
      and TLVs are described in <xref target="obj"/>. The procedures of Path
      Segment allocation are described in <xref target="pro"/>.</t>

      <t>There are various modes of operations, such as - <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The Path Segment can be allocated by Egress PCC. The PCE should
          request the Path Segment from Egress PCC.</t>

          <t>The PCE can allocate a Path Segment on its own accord and inform
          the ingress/egress PCC, useful for PCE-initiated LSPs.</t>

          <t>Ingress PCC can also request PCE to allocate the Path Segment, in
          this case, the PCE would either allocate and inform the assigned
          Path Segment to the ingress/egress PCC using PCEP messages, or first
          request egress PCC for Path Segment and then inform it to the
          ingress PCC.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The path information to the ingress PCC and PCE is exchanged via an
      extension to <xref target="RFC8664"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/>. The Path Segment
      information (for SR-MPLS) to the egress PCC can be informed via an
      extension to the PCECC-SR procedures <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>.</t>

      <t>For the PCE to allocate a Path Segment on its own, the PCE needs to
      be aware of the MPLS label space from the PCCs. This is done via
      mechanism as described in <xref
      target="I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space"/>. Otherwise, the PCE should
      request the egress PCC for Path Segment allocation.</t>

      <t>To notify (or request) the Path Segment to the Egress PCC, the

      on <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/>). The

      <section title="Stateful PCE Operation">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, a
        Path Segment can be allocated by the egress PCC. In this case, the
        label space is maintained on the PCC itself.</t>

        <t>This section describes the mechanism of Path Segment allocation by
        using PCInitiate and PCUpd message in Stateful PCE model.</t>

        <section anchor="ingress-PCC"
                 title="Ingress PCC-Initiated Path Segment Allocation">
          <t>The ingress PCC could request the Path Segment to be allocated by
          the PCE via PCRpt message. The delegate flag (D-flag) MUST also be
          set for this LSP. Also, the P-flag in the LSP object MUST be
          set.</t>

          <t>On receiving a delegation request with Path Segment allocation
          request from an ingress PCC, a stateful PCE requests the egress PCC
          to allocate a Path Segment.</t>

          <t>The PATH-SEGMENT TLV MUST be included in an LSP object in the
          PCInitiate message sent from the PCE to the egress to request Path
          Segment allocation by the egress PCC. The P flag in LSP object MUST
          be set to 0. This PCInitiate message to egress PCC would be the
          similar to the one sent to ingress PCC as per <xref
          target="RFC8664"/>, but the egress PCC would only allocate the Path
          Segment and would not trigger the LSP initiation operation (as it
          would be the egress for this LSP).</t>

          <t>If the value of Path Segment is 0x0, it indicates that the PCE is
          requesting a Path Segment for this LSP. If the Path Segment is set
          to a value 'n' and the P flag is unset in the LSP object, it
          indicates that the PCE requests a specific value 'n' of Path
          Segment. If the Path Segment is allocated successfully, the egress
          PCC reports the Path Segment via PCRpt message with PATH-SEGMENT TLV
          in LSP object. Else, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type =
          TBA7 ("Path SID failure") and Error Value = 1 ("Invalid SID"). If
          the value of Path Segment is valid, but the PCC is unable to
          allocate the Path Segment, it MUST send a PCErr message with
          Error-Type = TBA7 ("Path SID failure") and Error Value = 2 ("Unable
          to allocate the specified label/SID").</t>

          <t>Once the PCE receives the PCRpt message, it can obtain the Path
          Segment information from the egress PCC and then update the path
          with Path Segment by sending PCUpd message to the ingress PCC.</t>

          <t>If the Path Segment is updated successfully, the ingress PCC will
          acknowledge with a PCRpt message to the PCE. In case of error, an
          PCErr message with Error-Type = TBA7 ("Path SID failure") and Error
          Value = 1 ("Invalid SID") will be sent back to the PCE. The PCE MUST
          roll back the Path Segment value to the previous value (if any) by
          sending a PCUpd message to synchronize with the egress PCC.</t>

            <t>The ingress PCC could request the Path Segment to be allocated
            by the PCE via PCRpt message as per <xref target="RFC8231"/>. The
            delegate flag (D-flag) MUST also be set for this LSP. Also, the
            P-flag in the LSP object MUST be set.</t>

            <t>A PATH-SEGMENT TLV MUST be included in the LSP object. If the
            value of Path Segment is 0x0, it indicates that the Ingress PCC is
            requesting a Path Segment for this LSP. If the Path Segment is set
            to a value 'n', it indicates that the ingress PCC requests a
            specific value 'n' of Path Segment.</t>

            <t>If the Path Segment is allocated successfully, the PCE would
            further respond to Ingress PCC with PCUpd message as per <xref
            target="RFC8231"/> and MUST include the PATH-SEGMENT TLV in a LSP
            object. Else, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = TBA7
            ("Path SID failure") and Error Value = 1 ("Invalid SID"). If the
            value of Path Segment is valid, but the PCC is unable to allocate
            the Path Segment, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type =
            TBA7 ("Path SID failure") and Error Value = 2 ("Unable to allocate
            the specified label/SID").</t>

            <t>The active PCE would allocate the Path Segment as per the
            PATH-SEGMENT flags and in case PATH-SEGMENT is not included, the
            PCE MUST act based on the local policy.</t>

            <t>The PCE would further inform the egress PCC about the Path
            Segment allocated by the PCE using the PCInitiate message as

    <section anchor="DP" title="Dataplane Considerations">
      <t>As described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>,
      in an SR-MPLS network, when a packet is transmitted along an SR path,
      the labels in the MPLS label stack will be swapped or popped. So that no
      label or only the last label may be left in the MPLS label stack when
      the packet reaches the egress node. Thus, the egress node cannot
      determine from which SR path the packet comes. For this reason, it
      introduces the Path Segment.</t>

      <t>Apart from allocation and encoding of the Path Segment (described in
      this document) for the LSP, it would also be included in the SID/Label
      stack of the LSP (usually for processing by the egress). To support
      this, the Path Segment MAY also be a part of SR-ERO as prepared by the
      PCE as per <xref target="RFC8664"/>. The PCC MAY also include the Path
      Segment while preparing the label stack based on the local policy and
      use-case.</t>

      <t>It is important that the PCE learns the Maximum SID Depth (MSD) that
      can be imposed at each node/link of a given SR path to ensure that the
      SID stack depth does not exceed the number of SIDs the node is capable
      of imposing. As a new type of segment, Path Segment will be inserted in
      the SID list just like other SIDs. Thus, the PCE needs to consider the
      affect of Path Segment when computing a LSP with Path Segment
      allocation.</t>

      <t>Similar to SR-MPLS, when SRv6 Path Segment is implemented, SRv6
      dataplane is required to be supported on PCCs.</t>

      drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
      implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore,
      no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and
      working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
      benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
      experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols

      <t>As described <xref target="RFC8664"/> and <xref

      <t>Thus, as per <xref target="RFC8231"/>, it is RECOMMENDED that these
