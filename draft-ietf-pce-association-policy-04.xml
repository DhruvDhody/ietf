<t>
   This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate policies to 
   a group of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path Computation
   Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP).</t> 
   </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
   <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
   communication Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between
   a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE),
   or between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture
   <xref target="RFC4655"/>. <xref target="RFC5394"/>
   provides additional details on policy within the PCE architecture and
   also provides context for the support of PCE Policy. </t>


   <t>PCEP Extensions 
   for Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/> 
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels. 
   <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup and teardown of
   PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the
   need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network. Currently, the LSPs can either be signaled via Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) or can be
   segment routed as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>.</t>

   <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> introduces a generic
   mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to
   define associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such
   as configuration parameters or behaviors) and is equally applicable
   to stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and stateless PCE.</t>

   <t>This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or
   more LSPs with policies using the generic association mechanism.</t>
   
   <t>A PCEP speaker may want to influence the PCEP peer with respect 
   to path selection and other policies.  This document describes a 
   PCEP extension to associate policies by creating Policy Association 
   Group (PAG) and encoding this association in PCEP messages. The 
   specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless
   PCEP sessions.

    <section title="Motivation" toc="default">
   <t>Paths computed using PCE can be subjected to various policies on 
   both PCE and PCC.  For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
   scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specifies
   policies for traffic steering, path monitoring, etc., for some LSPs
   via the stateful PCE. Similarly, a PCC could request a user- or 
service-specific policy to be applied at the PCE, such as constraints relaxation to 
meet optimal QoS and resiliency. </t>  
   
   <t>PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> to associate a set
   of LSPs with a policy, without the need to know the
   details of such a policy, which simplifies network operations, avoids
   frequent software upgrades, as well provides an ability to introduce
   new policy faster.</t>

    <section title="Policy based Constraints" toc="default">
    <t>In the context of policy-enabled path computation
    <xref target="RFC5394"/>, path computation policies may be applied
    at both a PCC and a PCE. Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with
    a policy enabled PCC, it receives a service request via signaling,
    including over a Network-Network Interface (NNI) or User Network
    Interface (UNI) reference point, or receives a configuration request
    over a management interface to establish a service. The PCC may also
    apply user- or service-specific policies to decide how the path
    selection process should be constrained, that is, which constraints,
    diversities, optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation
    strategies should be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have
    a likelihood to be successfully established and provide necessary
    QoS and resilience against network failures. The user- or
    service-specific policies applied to PCC and are then passed to
    the PCE along with the Path computation request, in the form of
    constraints <xref target="RFC5394"/>. </t>

    <t>PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> to associate a set
    of LSPs with policy and its resulting path computation constraints.
    This would simplify the path computation message exchanges in PCEP.</t>
    </section>
    
    </section>
    <section title="Overview" toc="default">
     <t>As per <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/>, LSPs
     are associated with other LSPs with which they interact by adding
     them to a common association group.  Grouping can also be used to 
     define association between LSPs
     and policies associated to them.
      One new Association Type is defined in this document, 
      based on the generic Association object - 
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>Association type = TBD1 ("Policy 
      Association Type") for Policy Association Group (PAG). </t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
   <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> specify the mechanism for the capability
   advertisement of the association types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining a ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object. 
   This capability exchange for the association type described in this document (i.e. Policy Association Type) MUST be done before using the policy association.
   Thus the PCEP speaker MUST include the Policy Association Type (TBD1) in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV
      before using the PAG in the PCEP messages.</t>   
   <t>This Association-Type is operator-configured association in nature and 
   	created by the operator manually on the PCEP peers. The LSP belonging to 
   	this associations is conveyed via PCEP messages to the PCEP peer. 
   	Operator-configured
   Association Range SHOULD NOT be set for this association-type, and MUST be ignored, so that the full
   range of association identifier can be utilized.</t>

      <t>A PAG can have one or more LSPs and its associated policy. 
      	The association parameters including association identifier, type (Policy), as well as the association source IP address is manually
        configured by the operator and is used to identify the PAG as described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/>. The Global Association
   Source and Extended Association ID MAY also be included.</t>


    <t>As per the processing rules specified in section 5.4 of 
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/>, if  a PCEP speaker
   does not support this Policy
   association-type, it would return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 (Early allocation by IANA)
   "Association Error" and Error-Value 1 "Association-type is not
   supported". Since the PAG is opaque in nature, the PAG and the policy 
   MUST be configured on the PCEP peers as per the operator-configured association procedures. 
   All processing is as per section 5.4 of 
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/>.
   If a PCE speaker receives PAG in a PCEP message, and the
   policy association information is not configured, it MUST return
   a PCErr message with Error-Type TBD "Association Error" and Error-
   Value 4 "Association unknown".  If some of the 
    association information <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> (the TLVs defined in this document)
    received from the peer does not match the local configured values, the 
    PCEP speaker MUST reject the PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 (Early allocation by IANA)
   "Association Error" and Error-Value 5 "Operator-configured
   association information mismatch". </t>

<section title="Policy Association Group" toc="default">
    <t>Association groups
   and their memberships are defined using the ASSOCIATION object defined in 
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/>. Two object types for IPv4 and IPv6

     <t>The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is an optional TLV that can be carried in ASSOCIATION object (with "Policy Association Type") to carry opaque information needed to apply the policy at the PCEP peer. 
     In some cases to apply a PCE policy successfully, it is required to also associate some policy parameters that needs to be evaluated, to successfully apply the said policy. This TLV is used to 
     carry those policy parameters. The TLV could include one or more policy related parameter. The encoding format and the order MUST be known to the PCEP peers, this could be done during configuration of policy (and its association parameters) for the PAG. 
     The TLV format is as per the format of the PCEP TLVs, as defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, and shown in <xref target="fig-policy-tlv"/>. 
     Only one POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV can be carried and only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.</t>

     <t>The type of the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is TBD2 and it has a

The PCEP peer implementation need to be aware of the encoding format, order, and meaning of the 'Policy Parameters' well in advance based on the policy. Note that from the protocol point of view this data is opaque and can be used to carry parameters in any format understood by the PCEP peers and associated to the policy.

   <t>If the PCEP peer is unaware of the policy parameters associated with the policy and it receives the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV, it MUST ignore the TLV and SHOULD log this event.
   Further, if one or more parameters received in the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV received by the PCEP speaker are considered as unacceptable in the context of the associated policy (e.g. out of range value, badly encoded value...), the  PCEP speaker MUST NOT apply the received policy and SHOULD log this event.</t>

        <t>
   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at PCEP peers
   and associate it with the LSPs. They MAY also allow configuration to related policy parameters, in which case
   the an operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to parse the associated policy parameters TLV.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Information and Data Models" toc="default">
        <t>An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG configured. Further implementation SHOULD allow to view the current set of LSPs in the PAG.  To serve this purpose, the PCEP YANG module <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang"/> includes association groups and can be used for PAG.</t>
