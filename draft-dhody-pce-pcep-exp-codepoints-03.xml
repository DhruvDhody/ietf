   IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element (PCE) communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages,
   objects, TLVs). IANA established a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP
   codepoints and sub-registries. The allocation policy for each new 
   registry is by IETF Consensus.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.</t>

   <t>In section 9 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, IANA assigns values to 
   the PCEP protocol parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). IANA established 
   a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   The allocation policy for each new registry is by IETF Consensus as 
   described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>. Specifically, new assignments 
   are made via RFCs approved by the IESG. Typically, the IESG will seek input on prospective
   assignments from appropriate persons (e.g., a relevant Working Group
   if one exists). Early
   allocation <xref target="RFC7120"/> provides some latitude for allocation of these
   code points, but is reserved
   for features that are considered appropriately stable.</t> 
      
   <t>With some recent advancement, there is an enhanced need to 
   experiment with PCEP. It is often necessary
   to use some sort of number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment. In order to run experiment, it is important that 
   the value won't collide not only with existing codepoints but any 
   future allocation. </t>
   
   <t>This document thus set apart some codepoints
   in PCEP registry and subregistries for experimental usage. </t>

<section title="Handling of unknown experimentation">
	<t>A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental PCEP message, that it does not recognize, would react as per section 6.9 of 
	<xref target="RFC5440"/> by sending a PCErr message with Error-value=2 (capability not supported). 
</t>
   <t>A PCE that does not recognize an experimental PCEP object, MUST reject the
   entire PCEP message and MUST send a PCE error message with Error-
   Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported object", defined as per
   <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
   <t>As per section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, unknown experimental PCEP TLV would be ignored.</t>
