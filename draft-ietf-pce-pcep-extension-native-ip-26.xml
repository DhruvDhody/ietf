      <t>This document defines the Path Computation Element Communication
      Protocol (PCEP) extension for Central Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR)
      based applications in Native IP networks. It describes the key information
      that is transferred between Path Computation Element (PCE) and Path
      Computation Clients (PCC) to accomplish the End to End (E2E) traffic
      assurance in the Native IP network under PCE as a central controller.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Generally, Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering
      (MPLS-TE) requires the corresponding network devices to support
      Resource ReSerVation Protocol
      (RSVP)/Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) protocols to assure the
      End-to-End (E2E) traffic performance. But in native IP network scenarios
      described in <xref target="RFC8735"/>, there will be no such signaling
      protocol to synchronize the action among different network devices. It
      is necessary to use the central control mode described in <xref
      target="RFC8283"/> to correlate the forwarding behavior among different
      network devices. <xref target="RFC8821"/> describes the architecture and
      solution philosophy for the E2E traffic assurance in the Native IP network
      via multi Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session-based solution. This
      document describes the corresponding Path Computation Element
      Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions to transfer the key information
      about BGP peer, peer prefix advertisement, and the explicit peer
      route on on-path routers.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC9050"/> defined the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV to

        defined in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for Native IP:</t>

        <t>N (NATIVE-IP-TE-CAPABILITY - 1 bit - 30): If set to 1 by a PCEP
        speaker, it indicates that the PCEP speaker is capable of TE in a
        Native IP network as specified in this document. The flag MUST be set
        by both the PCC and PCE to support this extension.</t>

    <section title="PCECC Native IP TE Procedures">
      <t>The detail procedures for the TE in native IP environment are
      described in the following sections.</t>

      <section anchor="BGPSess" title="BGP Session Establishment Procedures">
        <t>The PCInitiate and PCRpt message pair is used to configure the
        parameters for a BGP peer session. This pair of PCEP messages is
        exchanged between a PCE and each BGP peer (acting as PCC) which needs to be
        configured. After the BGP peer session has been configured via this
        pair of PCEP messages, the BGP session establishes and operates in a
        normal fashion. The BGP peers can be configured for External BGP (EBGP) peers or Internal BGP (IBGP) peers. For IBGP connection topologies, the Route Reflector (RR) is
        required.</t>

        <t>The PCInitiate message should be sent to PCC which is acting as BGP
        router and/or RR.</t>

        <t>The RR topology for a single AS is shown in Figure 1. The BGP
        routers R1, R3, and R7 are within a single AS. R1 and R7 are BGP RR
        clients, and R3 is a RR. The PCInitiate message should be sent only
        the BGP routers that need to be newly configured R1 (via M1 message),
        R3 (via M2 &amp; M3 message), and R7 (via M4 message).</t>

        <t>PCInitiate message creates an auto-configuration function for these
        BGP peers by providing the indicated Peer AS and the Local/Peer IP
        Address.</t>

        <t>When PCC receives the BPI and CCI object (with the R bit set to 0
        in SRP object) in PCInitiate message, the PCC should try to establish
        the BGP session with the indicated Peer as per AS and Local/Peer IP
        address.</t>

        <t>When PCC creates successfully the BGP session that is indicated by
        the associated information, it should report the result via the PCRpt
        messages, with BPI object and the corresponding SRP and CCI object
        included.</t>

        <t>When PCC receives this message with the R bit set to 1 in SRP
        object in PCInitiate message, the PCC should clear the BGP session
        that is indicated by the BPI object.</t>

        <t>When PCC clears successfully the specified BGP session, it should
        report the result via the PCRpt message, with the BPI object included,
        and the corresponding SRP and CCI objects.</t>

      <section anchor="BGPEx" title="Explicit Route Establish Procedures">
        <t>The explicit route establishment procedures can be used to install
        a route via PCE on the PCC, using PCInitiate and PCRpt message pair.
        Such explicit routes operate the same as static routes installed by
        network management protocols(NETCONF/YANG). The procedures of such
        explicit route addition and remove must be controlled by the PCE in an
        specific order so that the pathways are established without loops.</t>

        <t>The PCInitiate message should be sent to the on-path routers
        respectively. In the example, for explicit route from R1 to R7, the
        PCInitiate message should be sent to R1 (via M1 message), R2 (via M2
        message) and R4 (via M3 message), as shown in Figure 2. For explicit
        route from R7 to R1, the PCInitiate message should be sent to R7 (via
        M1 message), R4 (via M2 message) and R2 (via M3 message), as shown in
        Figure 3.</t>

        <t>When PCC receives the EPR and the CCI object (with the R bit set to
        0 in SRP object) in PCInitiate message, the PCC should install the
        explicit route to the peer.</t>

        <t>When PCC install successfully the explicit route to the peer, it
        should report the result via the PCRpt messages, with EPR object and
        the corresponding SRP and CCI object included.</t>

        <t>When PCC receives the EPR and the CCI object with the R bit set to
        1 in SRP object in PCInitiate message, the PCC should clear the
        explicit route to the peer that indicated by the EPR object.</t>

        <t>When PCC clear successfully the explicit route that indicated by
        this object, it should report the result via the PCRpt message, with
        the EPR object included, and the corresponding SRP and CCI object.</t>

        <t>In order to avoid the transient loop while deploying the explicit
        peer route, the EPR object should be sent to the PCCs in the reverse
        order of the E2E path. To remove the explicit peer route, the EPR
        object should be sent to the PCCs in the same order of E2E path.</t>

        <t>To accomplish ECMP effects, the PCE can send multiple EPR objects
        to the same node, with the same route priority and peer address value
        but different next hop addresses.</t>

        <t>The PCC should verify that the next hop address is reachable. Upon

        PCErr message, with an error information:</t>

    <section title="BGP Considerations">
      <t>This document defines the procedures and objects to create the BGP
      sessions and advertise the associated prefixes dynamically. Only the key
      information, for example peer IP addresses, peer AS number are exchanged
      via the PCEP protocol. Other parameters that are needed for the BGP
      session setup should be derived from their default values, as described
      in <xref target="BPI_Object"/>.</t>

      <t>When the PCE sends out the PCInitiate message with BPI object
      embedded to establish the BGP session between the PCC peers, it should
      wait enough time to get the BGP session successful establishment report
      from the PCCs. If the PCE can't get such report after the
      duration, then it should declare the failure of BGP session setup and
      it could try the establishment procedure again, or report the failure to the
      operator. The wait time SHOULD be configurable by the operator.</t>

      <t>Upon receiving such key information, the BGP module on the PCC should
      try to accomplish the task appointed by the PCEP protocol and report the
      successful status to the PCEP modules after the session is setup.</t>

      <t>There is no influence on current implementation of BGP Finite State
      Machine (FSM). The PCEP focuses only on the success and failure status of
      BGP session, and acts upon such information accordingly.</t>

      <t>The error handling procedures related to incorrect BGP parameters are
      specified in <xref target="BGPSess"/>, <xref target="BGPEx"/>, and <xref
      target="BGPPrefix"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>The information transferred in this document is mainly used for the
      BGP session setup, explicit route deployment and the prefix
      distribution. The planning, allocation and distribution of the peer
      addresses within IGP should be accomplished in advanced and they are out
      of the scope of this document.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8232"/> describes the state synchronization
      procedure between stateful PCE and PCC. The communication of PCE and PCC
      described in this document should also follow the same procedures, treat
      the three newly defined objects (BPI, EPR, PPA) associated with the same
      symbolic path name as the attribute of the same path in the LSP-DB (LSP State Database).</t>

      <t>When PCE detects one or some of the PCCs are out of its control, it
      should recompute and redeploy the traffic engineering path for native IP
      on the currently active PCCs. The PCE should assure the avoidance of possible
      transient loop in such node failure when it deploys the explicit peer
      route on the PCCs.</t>

      <t>In case of a PCE failure, a new PCE can gain control over the central
      controller instructions as described in <xref target="RFC9050"/>.</t>

      <t>As per the PCEP procedures in <xref target="RFC8281"/>, the State
      Timeout Interval timer is used to ensure that a PCE failure does not
      result in automatic and immediate disruption for the services.
      Similarly, as per <xref target="RFC9050"/>, the central controller
      instructions are not removed immediately upon PCE failure. Instead, they
      could be re-delegated to the new PCE before the expiration of this
      timer, or be cleaned up on the expiration of this timer. This allows for
      network clean up without manual intervention. The PCC supports the
      removal of CCI as one of the behaviors applied on expiration of the
      State Timeout Interval timer.</t>

      <t>Manageability considerations that are described in <xref
      target="RFC9050"/> should be followed.</t>

    <section title="Implementation Status">
      <t>[Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
      well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]</t>

      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
      protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
      Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942]. The
      description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the
      IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please
      note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not
      imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to
      verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF
      contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be,
      a catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers are
      advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and
      working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
      benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
      experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
      more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this
      information as they see fit".</t>

      <section title="Proof of Concept based on ODL">
        <t>At the time of posting the -26 version of this document, there are
        no known implementations of this mechanism. A proof of concept for the
        overall design has been verified using another SBI protocol on the
        Open DayLight (ODL) controller.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="ZTE">
        <t>ZTE is preparing an implementation of this document as the time of
        posting the -26 version of this document.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>In this setup, the BGP sessions, prefix advertisement, and explicit peer
      route establishment are all controlled by the PCE. See <xref
      target="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC4272"/> for BGP security
      considerations. Security considerations in <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      and <xref target="RFC8231"/> should be considered. To prevent a bogus
      PCE from sending harmful messages to the network nodes, the network devices
      should authenticate the validity of the PCE and ensure a secure
      communication channel between them. Thus, the mechanisms described in <xref
      target="RFC8253"/> and <xref target="RFC9050"/> should be used.</t>
