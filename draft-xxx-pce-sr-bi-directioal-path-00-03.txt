         PCEP Extension for Segment Routing Bi-directional Path
                     draft-li-pce-sr-bidir-path-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Futhermore, PCEP can be used for computing uni-
   directional Segment Routing path.  However, Bi-directional SR path is
   required to be supported in many scenarios like mobile backhaul
   transport network.  The bi-directional SR path is defined in
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment].

   For supporting SR bi-directional path computation, this document
   specifies PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional SR
   paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR path when using a Stateful
   PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when
   using a Stateless PCE.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] leverages the
   source routing and tunneling paradigms.  SR supports to steer packets
   into an explicit forwarding path according to the Segment Routing
   Policy ( SR Policy) [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy] at
   the ingress node.

Internet-Draft      Bi-didirectional SR Path in PCEP          April 2018


   However, the SR Policies defined in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy] only supports uni-
   directional SR paths.  For supporting bi-directional paths
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], new SR policies carrying Path
   ID and bi-directional path information are defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to the Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] that allow a stateful
   PCE [RFC8231] to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths,
   as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s)
   and optimization criteria in SR networks.

   However, it does not support bi-directional SR path computation, so
   new extensions are required.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes, for
   example primary and secondary LSP associations, and is equally
   applicable to the active and passive modes of a Stateful PCE
   [RFC8231] or a stateless PCE [RFC5440].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir] defines PCEP extensions for grouping
   two reverse unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an Associated
   Bidirectional LSP when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated
   and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when using a Stateless PCE.

   This document specifies PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
   unidirectional SR paths into a bi-directional SR path when using a
   Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated paths as well
   as when using a Stateless PCE.  For binding SR paths, the PATH-ID TLV
   [draft-li-pce-path-segment] MUST be included in the LSP object.  The
   path ID can be a path segment in SR-MPLS
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], or a path ID in SRv6
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np], or other IDs that can
   identify an SR path.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].  The reader is assumed to be familiar
   with the terminology defined in [RFC5440], [RFC8231],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

3.  PCEP Extension for Bi-directional Path

   This document describes the mechanism of carring bi-directional path
   information in PCEP messages.  For binding two SR paths into a single
   bi-directional path, PATH-ID TLVs should be included in LSP objects
   as described in [draft-li-pce-path-segment].  Futhermore, this
   document defines an association group objects, Double-sided Bi-
   directional SR Path Association Group object for associating SR
   paths.

3.1.  Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group Object

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir], two LSPs are
   associated as a bi-directional LSP by a common bi-directional LSP
   association group.  For associating two SR paths, this document
   defines a Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Groups.
   The Association Type of Double-sided Bidirectional SRv6 Path
   Association Group is TBD.

   A member of the Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group
   can take the role of a forward or reverse SR path and follows the
   rules similar to the rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir] for LSPs.

   o  An SR path (forward or reverse) can not be part of more than one
      Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group.  More than
      one forward SR and/ or reverse SR path can be part of a Double-
      sided Bi-directional SR Association Group.

   The SR paths belonging to this association are conveyed via PCEP
   messages to the PCEP peer.  The object endcoding follows the rules
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

   The Association ID, Association Source, optional Global Association
   Source and optional Extended Association ID in the Bi-directional SR
   Path Association Group Object are initialized using the procedures
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and [RFC7551].

   For describing the SR paths in a association group, such as direction
   and co-routed information, this document reuses the Bi-directional
   LSP Association Group TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir].  All fields and processing rules
   are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir].

4.  Procedures of Bi-directional Path Computation

   As defined in [RFC5440], the B-flag in RP object MUST be set when the
   PCC specifies that the path computation request relates to a bi-
   directional TE LSP.  In this document, the B-flag also MUST be set
   when the PCC specifies that the path computation request relates to a
   bi-directional SR path.  Likely, when a stateful PCE initiates or
   updates a bi-directional paths including LSPs and SR paths, the
   B-flag in SRP object [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls] MUST be
   set as well.

   The bi-directional path computation can be divided into two uni-
   directional path computations.  Thus the operations of path
   computation and path ID allocation for uni-directional path as
   defined in [draft-li-pce-sr-path-segment] can apply to bi-directional
   path computation directly.

   Two uni-directional paths can be associated by the association group
   object [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] with the same association ID
   and the same association type.  A bi-directional path association
   group object has been defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir] for
   binding paths in MPLS.  As defined in this document, two SR paths
   with the PATH-ID TLV [draft-li-pce-sr-path-segment] included in the
   LSP object can be associated by a Bi-directional SR Path Association
   Group with the same association ID.

   After path computation, the bi-directional path that combined by two
   SR paths and associated by an association group object will be sent
   to the source and destination PCC( as known as the ingress node and
   egress node in SR) by PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate messages,
   respectively.

   A PCEP message such as PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate, containing a bi-
   directional path, sent to the PCC contains a forward direction path
   beginning from itself to the remote PCC and a reverse path from the
   remote PCC back to the PCC itself.  The information of reverse
   direction path can be used for several scenarios, such as directed
   BFD [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed].

4.1.  PCE Initiated SR Paths

   Being identical to the rules specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir], Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path
   Association Groups can be created by a Stateful PCE.

   o  Stateful PCE can create and update the forward and reverse SR path
      independently for Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association
      Groups.

   o  Stateful PCE can establish and remove the association relationship
      on a per SR path basis.

   o  Stateful PCE can create and update the SR path and the association
      on a PCC via PCInitiate and PCUpd messages, respectively, using
      the procedures described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

4.2.  PCC Initiated SR Paths

   Being identical to the rules specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir], Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path
   Association Groups can also be created by a PCC.

   o  PCC can create and update the forward and reverse SR paths
      independently for Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association
      Groups.

   o  PCC can establish and remove the association relationship on a per
      SR path basis.

   o  PCC MUST report the change in the association group of an SR path
      to PCE(s) via PCRpt message.

   o  PCC can report the forward and reverse SR paths independently to
      PCE(s) via PCRpt message.

   o  PCC can delegate the forward and reverse SR paths independently to
      a Stateful PCE, where PCE would control the SR paths.

   o  Stateful PCE can update the SR paths in the Double-sided Bi-
      directional SR Path Association Group via PCUpd message, using the
      procedures described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

4.3.  Stateless PCE

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir], for a stateless PCE,
   it might be useful to associate a path computation request to an
   association group, thus enabling it to associate a common set of
   configuration parameters or behaviors with the request.  A PCC can
   request co-routed or non co-routed forward and reverse direction
   paths from a stateless PCE for a bidirectional LSP association group.
