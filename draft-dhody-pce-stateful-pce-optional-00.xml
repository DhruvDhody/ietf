<t>
   This document introduces a mechanism to mark some Path Computation
   Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) objects as optional during PCEP messages exchange for the Stateful PCE model.</t> 
   </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
   <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
   communication Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between
   a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE),
   or between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture
   <xref target="RFC4655"/>. </t>

   <t>PCEP Extensions 
   for Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/> 
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels. 
   <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup and teardown of
   PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the
   need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> defined P flag as part of Common Object Header
   to allow a PCC to specify
      in a PCReq message sent to a PCE whether the object must be taken
      into account by the PCE during path computation or is just
      optional. The I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep
      message to indicate to a PCC whether or not an optional object was
      processed. Stateful PCE <xref target="RFC8231"/> 
      specified that  P and I flags of the PCEP
   objects defined in <xref target="RFC8231"/> MUST be set to 0 on
   transmission and SHOULD be ignored on receipt since they are
   exclusively related to path computation requests. The behavior for P and I flag in 
   other objects defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/> and other extension was not specified. 
   This document clarifies how the P and I flag could be used in stateful PCE model to identify 
   optional objects in the Path Computation State Report (PCRpt),  the Path Computation Update Request (PCUpd) 
   and the LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message.</t>

      <t>This document defines one new type for association, which do not add any new
      security concerns beyond those discussed in <xref target="RFC5440"/>,
      <xref target='RFC8231'/> and <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> in itself.</t>
      <t> Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
        as extra sensitive
      and thus should employ suitable PCEP security mechanisms like <xref target='RFC8253'/>. 
      Also extra care needs to be taken by the implementation with respect to POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding, verifying and applying these policy variables. </t>

        <t>
   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at PCEP peers
   and associate it with the LSPs. They MAY also allow configuration to related policy parameters, in which case
   the an operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to parse the associated policy parameters TLV.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Information and Data Models" toc="default">
        <t>An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG configured. Further implementation SHOULD allow to view the current set of LSPs in the PAG.  To serve this purpose, the PCEP YANG module <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang"/> includes association groups and can be used for PAG.</t>
