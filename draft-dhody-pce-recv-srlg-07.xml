      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering (TE) in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).</t>
   <t>This document provides extensions for the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) to receive Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)
   information during path computation via encoding this information
   in the path computation reply message.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
    <t>As per <xref target="RFC4655"/>, PCE based path computation model is
    deployed in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.
    In such case PCEs may cooperate with each other to provide end to end
    optimal path. </t>
    <t>It is important to understand which TE links in the network might be
   at risk from the same failures.  In this sense, a set of links can
   constitute a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if they share a resource
   whose failure can affect all links in the set <xref target="RFC4202"/>.
   H-LSP (Hierarchical LSP) or S-LSP (Stitched LSP) can be used for carrying
   one or more other LSPs as described in <xref target="RFC4206"/> and
   <xref target="RFC6107"/>. H-LSP and S-LSP may be computed by PCE(s) and
   further form as a TE link. The SRLG information of such LSPs can be
   obtained during path computation itself and encoded in the PCEP Path Computation
   Reply (PCRep) message.  <xref target='I-D.zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app'/> describes
   the use of a PCE for end to end User-Network Interface (UNI) path computation.</t>

   <t>Note that <xref target='RFC8001'/> specifies
   a extension to Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   where SRLG information is collected at the time of signaling. But in case a PCE
  or cooperating PCEs are used for path computation it is recommended that SRLG information is
   provided by the PCE(s) during the path computation itself to the ingress (PCC) rather
   than receiving this information during signaling. </t>

   <t>Further, for other path setup types (PST), (such as segment routing (SR), PCE as central controller (PCECC)) using a PCEP based approach for 
    SRLG information is useful.</t>

   <t><xref target='RFC7926'/> describes a
   scaling problem with SRLGs in multi-layer environment and introduce a concept of
   Macro SRLG (MSRLG). Lower layer SRLG are abstracted at the time of path computation and can
   be the basis to generate such a Macro SRLG at the PCE.</t>
      <section title="Requirements Language"
               toc="default">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119" /> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
      <t>The following terminology is used in this document.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="CPS:">Confidential Path Segment.  A segment of a path that contains
          nodes and links that the policy requires not to be disclosed
          outside the domain.</t>
          <t hangText="PCE:">Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
          or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
          network graph and applying computational constraints.</t>
          <t hangText="SRLG:">Shared Risk Link Group.</t>
          <t hangText="UNI:">User-Network Interface.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Usage of SRLG" toc="default">
    <t><xref target="RFC4202"/> states that a set of links can constitute
    a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if they share a resource whose failure
    can affect all links in the set. For example, two fibers in the same
    conduit would be in the same SRLG. If an LSR is required to have
    multiple diversely routed LSPs to another LSR, the path computation
    should attempt to route the paths so that they do not have any links
    in common, and such that the path SRLGs are disjoint.</t>
    <t>In case a PCE or cooperating PCEs are used for path computation,
    the SRLG information is provided by the PCE(s). For example, disjoint paths
    for inter-domain or inter-layer LSPs.  In order to achieve path computation
    for a secondary (backup) path, a PCC may request the PCE for a route that must
    be SRLG disjoint from the primary (working) path. The Exclude Route Object
    (XRO) <xref target="RFC5521"/> is used to specify SRLG information to be
    explicitly excluded.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PCEP Requirements" toc="default">

    <t>Following key requirements are identified for PCEP to
    receive SRLG information during path computation:</t>
    <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="SRLG Indication:">The PCEP speaker SHOULD be capable
   of indicating whether the SRLG information of the path is to be received during
   the path computation procedure to PCE.</t>
          <t hangText="SRLG:">If requested, the SRLG information SHOULD be
   received during the path computation and encoded in the PCEP message from PCE.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Cooperating PCEs <xref target="RFC4655"/> with inter-PCE communication
      work together to provide the end to end optimal path as well as the SRLG
      information of this path. During inter-domain or inter-layer path computation,
      the aggregating PCE (Parent PCE <xref target="RFC6805"/> or Ingress PCE(1)
      <xref target="RFC5441"/> or Higher-Layer PCE <xref target="RFC5623"/>)
      should receive the SRLG information of path segments from other PCEs and
      provide the end to end SRLG information of the optimal path to the Path
      Computation Client (PCC).</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Extension to PCEP" toc="default">
    <t>This document defines a new TLV that can be carried in the LSPA (LSP Attributes) object
   <xref target="RFC5440"/> so that a PCEP speaker can request SRLG information
   along with the path from the PCE. The SRLG subobject maybe carried inside
   the Explicit Route Object (ERO) in the PCEP message from PCE.</t>
    <section title="SRLG Information TLV" toc="default">
    <t>This document specify a new TLV for the LSPA Object to indicate that the PCE SHOULD provide the SRLG information along with the path. Its format is
   shown in the following figure:</t>

    <section title="Other Considerations" toc="default">
    <section title="Other Path Setup Types" toc="default">
      <t>Initially PCEP was used for LSPs
   that are set up using the RSVP-TE signaling protocol.  However, other
   TE path setup methods are possible within the PCE architecture such as SR <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>.</t>
   <t><xref target='RFC8001'/> describes
      SRLG information collection via RSVP-TE extension, which can
      not be used for Segment Routing (SR), making PCE
      the best source for the SRLG information for SR.</t>
    </section>  
    <section title="Backward Compatibility" toc="default">
    <t>If a PCE receives a PCEP message and the PCE does not understand the
   new TLV in the LSPA object, then as per <xref target="RFC5440"/>,
   it would ignore the TLV. In which case, the PCC will receive ERO with
   no SRLG subobject and can determine that the PCE does not support the
   PCEP extention as defined in this document.</t>
   <t>If PCEP speaker receives a PCEP message with SRLG subobject that it does
   not support or recognize, it would act according to the existing processing
   rules of the ERO as per <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Confidentiality via PathKey" toc="default">
    <t><xref target="RFC5520"/> defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment
   of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS). The CPS may
   be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCEP
   and signaled within in a RSVP-TE ERO.</t>
   <t>When path-key confidentiality is used, encoding
   SRLG information in PCRep along with the path-key could be useful to compute a SRLG
   disjoint backup path at the later instance.</t>
   <t>The path segment that needs to be hidden (that is, CPS) MAY be
    replaced in the ERO with a PKS. The PCE MAY use the SRLG Sub-objects
    in the ERO along with the PKS sub-object.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Coherent SRLG IDs" toc="default">
    <t>
   In a multi-layer multi-domain scenario, SRLG ids may be configured by
   different management entities in each layer/domain.  In such
   scenarios, maintaining a coherent set of SRLG IDs is a key
   requirement in order to be able to use the SRLG information properly.
   Thus, SRLG IDs must be unique.  Note that current procedure is
   targeted towards a scenario where the different layers and domains
   belong to the same operator, or to several coordinated administrative
   groups.  Ensuring the aforementioned coherence of SRLG IDs is beyond
   the scope of this document. Further scenarios, where coherence in the SRLG IDs cannot be
   guaranteed are out of the scope of the present document and are left
   for further study.

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t> The procedures defined in
   this document permit the transfer of SRLG data between layers or
   domains during the path computation of LSPs, subject to policy at
   the PCE.  It is recommended that PCE
   policies take the implications of releasing SRLG information into
   consideration and behave accordingly during path computation. Other
      security concerns are discussed in <xref target="RFC5440"/>.
      An analysis of the
   security issues for routing protocols that use TCP (including PCEP)
