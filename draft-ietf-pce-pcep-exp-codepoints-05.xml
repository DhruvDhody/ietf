    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.</t>

   <t>Further, in order to support use cases described in <xref target="RFC8051"/>, 
   <xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   LSPs via PCEP. <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.</t>

   <t>In section 9 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, IANA assigns values to 
   the PCEP protocol parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). 


   <!--[Jon] IANA established 
   a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   The allocation policy for each new registry is by IETF Review as 
   described in <xref target="RFC8126"/>.--> 

   IANA established a top-
   level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   This top-level registry contains sub-registries for PCEP message,
   object and TLV types.  The allocation policy for each of these
   sub-registries is IETF Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>.

   Also, early
   allocation <xref target="RFC7120"/> provides some latitude for allocation of these
   code points, but is reserved
   for features that are considered appropriately stable.</t> 
      
   <t><!--[Jon] With some recent advancement, there is an enhanced need to 
   experiment with PCEP.-->  Recently, there have been rapid advancements in PCE technology, which
   has created an enhanced need to experiment with PCEP. It is often necessary
   to use some sort of number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment. In order to run experiments, it is important that 
   the value won't collide not only with existing codepoints but any 
   future allocation. </t>
   
   <t><!--This document thus set apart some codepoints
   in PCEP registry and subregistries for experimental usage.-->
   This document updates <xref target="RFC5440"/> by changing the allocation policies
    for these three registries to mark some of the code points as
    assigned for Experimental Use.  As stated in [RFC3692], experiments using these code points 
    are not intended to be used in general deployments and due care taken while assigning the correct codepoints. See <xref target="RFC3692"/> for further discussion
    of the use of experimental codepoints.

<section title="Handling of Unknown Experimentation">
	<t>A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental PCEP message, that it does not recognize, would react as per section 6.9 of 
	<xref target="RFC5440"/> by sending a PCErr message with Error-value=2 (capability not supported). 
</t>
   <t><!-- [Jon] A PCE that does not recognize an experimental PCEP object, will reject the
   entire PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported object" as described 
   in <xref target="RFC5440"/>.--> 
   <!-- [Jon2] If the PCE does not understand or support an experimental object with the P flag 
   set in the Object Header, in the Path Computation Request message (PCReq), the
   entire PCEP message is rejected and PCE responds with a PCErr message with
   Error-Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported object" as described in <xref target="RFC5440"/>. 
   Otherwise the object is ignored. In case of stateful PCE messages <xref target="RFC8231"/>, the P flag
   is ignored and the unknown object handling is as per the stateful PCE 
   extensions.-->

   <!-- [Julien] If a PCEP speaker does not understand or support an experimental object
   then the way it handles this situation depends on the message type.
   For example, a PCE handles an unknown object in the Path Computation Request
   (PCReq) message according to the rules of <xref target="RFC5440"/>.  A PCC handles an
   unknown object in an Update (PCUpd) message according to the rules of <xref target="RFC8231"/>
   and, in an LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message, according to the rules of
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/>.  Any document that adds a new PCEP message
   type must specify how to handle unknown objects on that message.-->

      <!-- [changed again] If the PCE does not understand or support an experimental object with
   the P flag set in the Object Header, in the Path Computation Request
   message (PCReq), the entire PCEP message is rejected and PCE responds
   with a PCErr message with Error-Type="Unknown Object" or "Not
   supported object" as described in [RFC5440]. Otherwise, the object is
   ignored. Message-specific behavior may be specified (e.g., [RFC8231]
   defines rules for a PCC to handle an unknown object in an Update
   (PCUpd) message).-->

      If a PCEP speaker does not understand or support an experimental
   object then the way it handles this situation depends on the message
   type.  For example, a PCE handles an unknown object in the Path
   Computation Request (PCReq) message according to the rules of
   <xref target="RFC5440"/>. Message-specific behavior may be specified (e.g.,
   <xref target="RFC8231"/> defines rules for a PCC to handle an unknown object in a
   Path Computation LSP Update (PCUpd) Request message).

    </t>
   <t>As per section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, unknown experimental PCEP TLV would be ignored.</t>

    Based on feedback from the PCE WG, it was decided to allocate an
   Experimental code point range only in the message, object and TLV
   sub-registries.  The justification for this decision is that, if
   an experiment finds that it wants to use a new code point in
   another PCEP sub-registry, it can implement the same function using
   a new experimental object or TLV instead.
