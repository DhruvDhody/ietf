<abstract>

<t>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs). When a PCE has stateful control over LSPs it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify the attributes (especially the paths) of the LSPs. A Path Computation Client (PCC) has set up LSPs under local configuration may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE.</t>

<t>There are use-cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain control of locally configured LSPs of which it is aware but that have not been delegated to the PCE.</t>

<t>This document describes an extension to the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make such requests.</t>


</abstract>

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions <xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP <xref target="RFC5440"/> to enable stateful control of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) between and across PCEP sessions in compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>.  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, delegation of control of LSPs to PCE, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The stateful PCEP defines the following two useful network operations:

<list style="symbols">
        <t>Delegation: As per <xref target="RFC8051"/>, an operation to grant a PCE temporary rights to modify a
      subset of LSP parameters on one or more LSPs of a PCC.  LSPs are
      delegated from a PCC to a PCE and are referred to as "delegated"
      LSPs.</t>
       
 <t>Revocation: As per <xref target="RFC8231"/>, an operation performed by a PCC on a previously
      delegated LSP.  Revocation revokes the rights granted to the PCE
      in the delegation operation.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>For Redundant Stateful PCEs (section 5.7.4. of <xref target="RFC8231"/>), during a PCE failure, one of the redundant PCE could request to take control over an LSP.  The redundant PCEs may use a local policy or a proprietary election mechanism to decide which PCE would take control. In this case, a mechanism is needed for a stateful PCE to request control of one or more LSPs from a PCC, so that a newly elected primary PCE can request to take over control.</t> 

<t>In case of virtualized PCEs (vPCE) running as virtual network function (VNF), as the computation load in the network increases, a new instance of vPCE could be instantiated to balance the current load. The PCEs could use proprietary algorithm to decide which LSPs to be assigned to the new vPCE. Thus having a mechanism for the PCE to request control of some LSPs is needed.</t>

<t>In some deployments, the operator would like to use stateful PCE for global optimization algorithms but would still like to keep the control of the LSP at the PCC. In such cases, a stateful PCE could request to take control during the global optimization and return the delegation once done.</t>

<t>Note that <xref target="RFC8231"/> specify a mechanism for a PCC to delegate an orphaned LSP to another PCE. The mechanism defined in this document can be used in conjunction to <xref target="RFC8231"/>. Ultimately, it is the PCC that decides which PCE to delegate the orphaned LSP.</t>

<!-- Dhruv commented this section
<t>Some network operators prefer head-end (PCC) based reactivity to network events (e.g., link failure). For example, typically operators would like to reduce the time that backup LSP are being used for fast-reroute protection as the links that a backup LSP traverses may be congested when fast-reroute is active. PCC based LSP failure detection and re-routing mechanisms enable operators to minimize the duration of such congestion and meet operational requirements/constraints. As such, during normal operations, it may be preferable for PCC to have full control of its LSPs. However, operators shall prefer to use PCE for planned events such as centralized optimization and placement of LSPs. In this case, it is preferable for a PCE to obtain the control of one or more LSPs from a PCC, rather than waiting for the PCC to delegate the control. Once the PCE completes its operation, it relinquishes the control of the LSPs. Such capability enables operators  to combine the benefits of both centralized and distributed control of TE LSPs to get the best of both worlds.</t> 
-->

<t>This specification provides a simple extension, by using this a PCE can request control of one or more LSPs from any PCC over the stateful PCEP session. The procedures for granting and relinquishing control of the LSPs are specified in accordance with the specification <xref target="RFC8231"/>. </t>

<t>A new flag, the "LSP-Control Request Flag" (C), is introduced in the SRP object. On a PCUpd message, a PCE sets the C Flag to 1 to indicate that, it wishes to gain control of LSPs. The LSPs are identified by the LSP object. A PLSP-ID of value other than 0 and 0xFFFFF is used to identify the LSP for which the PCE requests control. The PLSP-ID value of 0 indicates that the PCE is requesting control of all LSPs originating from the PCC that it wishes to delegate. The C flag has no meaning in the PCRpt and PCInitiate message and MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>

</section> 

<section anchor="Operation" title="Operation"> 

<t>During normal operation, a PCC that wishes to delegate the control of an LSP sets the D Flag (delegate) to 1 in all PCRpt messages pertaining to the LSP. The PCE confirms the delegation by setting D Flag to 1 in all PCUpd messages pertaining to the LSP. The PCC revokes the control of the LSP from the PCE by setting D Flag to 0 in PCRpt messages pertaining to the LSP. If the PCE wishes to relinquish the control of the LSP, it sets D Flag to 0 in all PCUpd messages pertaining to the LSP.</t>

<t>If a PCE wishes to gain control over an LSP, it sends a PCUpd message with C Flag set to 1 in SRP object. The LSP for which the PCE requests control is identified by the PLSP-ID. The PLSP-ID of 0 indicates that the PCE wants control over all LSPs originating from the PCC. A PCC that receives a PCUpd message with C Flag set to 1 and PLSP-ID of 0 MUST NOT trigger the error condition for unknown PLSP-ID in an LSP update request as per <xref target="RFC8231"/>. The PCE SHOULD NOT send control request for LSP which is already delegated to the PCE, i.e. if the D flag is set in the PCUpd message, then C flag SHOULD NOT be set. If a PCC receives a PCUpd message with D flag set in the LSP object (i.e. LSP is already delegated) and
the C flag is also set (i.e. PCE is making a control request), the PCC MUST ignore the C Flag. A PCC can decide to delegate the control of the LSP at its own discretion. If the PCC grants or denies the control, it sends PCRpt message with D Flag set to 1 and 0 respectively in accordance with stateful PCEP <xref target="RFC8231"/>. If the PCC does not grant the control, it MAY choose to not respond, and the PCE MAY choose to retry requesting the control preferably using exponentially increasing timer. A PCE ignores the C Flag on the PCRpt message. Note that, the PCUpd message with C flag set is received for a currently non-delegated LSP (for which the PCE is requesting delegation), this MUST NOT trigger the error handling as specified in <xref target="RFC8231"/> (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation)
   and error-value 1 (Attempted LSP Update Request for a non-delegated
   LSP)).</t>

<t>As per <xref target="RFC8231"/>, a PCC cannot delegate an LSP to more than one PCE at any time. If a PCE requests control of an LSP that has already been delegated by the PCC to another PCE, the PCC MAY ignore the request, or MAY revoke
   the delegation to the first PCE before delegating it to the second. This choice is a matter of local policy.</t>

<!--<t>It should be noted that a legacy implementation of PCC, that does not understand the C flag in PCUpd message, would simply ignore the flag (and the request to grant control over the LSP). At the same time it would trigger the error condition as specified in <xref target="RFC8231"/> (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation)
   and error-value 1 (Attempted LSP Update Request for a non-delegated
   LSP)).</t>-->


   <t>It should be noted that a legacy implementation of PCC, that does not
  support this extension would trigger the error condition as specified 
  in <xref target="RFC8231"/> (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and 
  error-value 1 (Attempted LSP Update Request for a non-delegated LSP)) as
  the D flag would be unset in this update request. Further, in case of PLSP-ID of 0, the error condition as specified 
  in <xref target="RFC8231"/> (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and 
  error-value 3 (Attempted LSP Update Request for an LSP identified by an unknown PSP-ID)) would be triggered.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model. It also specify how a PCE MAY obtain control over an orphaned LSP
   that was PCE-initiated. A PCE implementation can apply the mechanism described
   in this document in conjunction with those in <xref target="RFC8281"/>.</t>
