    Support for Multi-Topology (MT) in the Path Computation Element
                     Communication Protocol (PCEP).
                        draft-xxx-pce-pcep-mt-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
   functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.

   Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP networks with the use
   of MT-aware IGPs.  This document specify the extension to PCE
   communication protocol (PCEP) to carry MT information in the PCEP
   messages.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication
   Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
   purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as
   well as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
   control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
   [RFC4657].  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP State

Internet-Draft                   PCEP-MT                   February 2019


   Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of control over
   LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path
   computations within and across PCEP sessions.  The model of operation
   where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in [RFC8281].

   Some protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, allow a single network to be
   viewed as multiple topologies [RFC4915] [RFC5120].  Deploying multi-
   topology (MT) routing allows different paths through the network to
   be selected to support different traffic or to offer protection paths
   in the event of failures.  A 16-bit Multi-Topology identifier (MT-ID)
   is used to identify the topology.

   This document extends PCEP to allow MT-ID to be encoded in the PCEP
   messages.

1.1.  Applicability to Enhanced VPN (VPN+)

   The framework for an enhanced virtual private network (VPN+) is
   described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].  Driven largely by needs
   arising from the 5G mobile network design, the concept of network
   slicing has gained traction.  There is a need to create a VPN service
   with enhanced isolation and performance characteristics.
   Specifically, there is a need for a transport network to support a
   set of virtual networks, each of which provides the client with some
   dedicated (private) network resources drawn from a shared pool.  The
   tenant of such a virtual network can require a degree of isolation
   and performance that previously could only be satisfied by dedicated
   networks.  Additionally the tenant may ask for some level of control
   of their virtual networks e.g. to customize the service paths in
   their network slices.

   These properties cannot be met with pure overlay networks, as they
   require tighter coordination and integration between the underlay and
   the overlay network.  [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] provides the
   framework of enhanced VPN and describes the candidate component
   technologies.  [I-D.dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn] describes how
   segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is used to construct the required
   virtual networks with the network resources allocated for enhanced
   VPN services.

   The Multi-Topology (MT) extension to PCEP as described in this
   document can also be used for he construction of virtual networks for
   enhanced VPN services, together with the segment routing.

2.1.  MT Object

   A new MT object is defined to indicate the MT-ID.  The MT object MAY
   be carried within PCReq to indicate that the path computation needs
   to be carried on the topology identified by the MT-ID.  The MT object
   MAY be carried with PCRep in case of failure to indicate the path
   computation was not successful on the topology identified by the MT-
   ID.

   MT Object-Class is TBD1.

   MT Object-Type is 1.

   The format of the MT object body is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Reserved (16 bits): This field MUST be set to zero on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   MT-ID (16-bits): This field corresponds to the 16-bit Multi-Topology
   ID.  The value 0 represents the default MT topology.

   No TLVs are currently defined for the MT object.

   The new MT object defined in this document can also be used with the
   stateful PCE extensions.  A PCC MAY include the MT object in PCRpt to
   indicate the topology on which the path for the LSP needs to be
   calculated.  The PCE MAY include the MT object in PCUpd and
   PCInitiate message to indicate the topology on which the path was
   computed.

2.2.3.  PCRpt Message

   A Path Computation LSP State Report message (also referred to as
   PCRpt message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a PCE to report the
   current state or delegate control of an LSP.

   The format of the PCRpt message is described in [RFC8231] which uses
   the <attribute-list> as defined in [RFC5440] and extended by PCEP
   extensions.

   The PCRpt message can use the updated <attribute-list> (as extended
   in Section 2.2.2) for the purpose of including the MT object.

2.2.4.  PCUpd Message

   A Path Computation LSP Update Request message (also referred to as
   PCUpd message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a PCE to update
   attributes of an LSP.

   The format of the PCUpd message is described in [RFC8231] which uses
   the <attribute-list> as defined in [RFC5440] and extended by PCEP
   extensions.

   The PCUpd message can use the updated <attribute-list> (as extended
   in Section 2.2.2) for the purpose of including the MT object.

2.2.5.  PCInitiate message

   An LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message is a PCEP message sent
   by a PCE to a PCC to trigger LSP instantiation or deletion.

   The format of the PCInitiate message is described in [RFC8231] which
   uses the <attribute-list> as defined in [RFC5440] and extended by
   PCEP extensions.

   The PCInitiate message can use the updated <attribute-list> (as
   extended in Section 2.2.2) for the purpose of including the MT
   object.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new MT object that do not add any new
   security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440] in itself.
   Some deployments may find the MT information to be extra sensitive
   and could be used to influence path computation and setup with
   adverse effect.  Additionally, snooping of PCEP messages with such
   data or using PCEP messages for network reconnaissance may give an
   attacker sensitive information about the operations of the network.
   Thus, such deployment should employ suitable PCEP security mechanisms
   like TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] or Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC8253].  The procedure based on TLS is considered a
   security enhancement and thus is much better suited for the sensitive
   information.
