    <abstract>
      <t>The ability to determine paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol 
      Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label 
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) is one the key requirements for Path Computation Element 
      (PCE). The PCEP has been extentded for intra and inter domain path computation via PCE(s)
      for P2MP TE LSP. </t>
      <t>This document describes the motivation and PCEP extension for explicitly 
      specifying abstract nodes for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations 
      during P2MP path computation via PCE(s).</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The PCE architecture is defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>.  <xref target="RFC5862"/> 
      lay out the requirements for PCEP to support P2MP path computation. 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis"/> describe an extension to PCEP to compute optimal constrained 
      intra-domain (G)MPLS P2MP TE LSPs. <xref target="RFC7334"/> describes the 
      mechanism for inter-domain P2MP path computation. </t>
      <t>Further <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis"/> describes mechanism to specify a list of nodes that can be 
      used as branch nodes or a list of nodes that cannot be used as branch nodes via Branch 
      Node Capability (BNC) object. The BNC object is used to specify which nodes have the 
      capability to act as a branch nodes or which nodes lack the capabilty. It supports IPv4 
      and IPv6 prefix sub-objects only. </t>
      <t>This document explains the need to add 
      the capability to explicitly specify any abstract nodes (not just nodes with branch node 
      capabiltiy) for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC7334"/> describes the core-tree procedure to compute 
      inter-domain P2MP tree. It assumes that, due to deployment and commercial limitations, 
      the sequence of domains for a path (the path domain tree) will be known in advance. 
      For a group of destination which belong to a particular destination domain, the domain-sequence needs 
      to be encoded separately as described in <xref target="RFC7897"/>. The mechanism, as described in 
      this document, of explicitly specifying abstract nodes for inclusion or exclusion for 
      a subset of destinations can be used for this purpose, where abstract nodes are domains. </t>
      <t>Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application scenarios,
   in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in <xref target="RFC8051"/>.  These
   scenarios apply equally to P2P and P2MP TE LSPs.
   <xref target="RFC8231"/> provides the fundamental extensions
   needed for stateful PCE to support general functionality for P2P TE
   LSP.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/> provides the an extensions
   needed for stateful PCE-initiated P2P TE LSP.  Complementarily, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp"/>
   focuses on the extensions that are necessary in order for
   the deployment of stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs.</t>

   <t>Domain D1, Domain D2, Domain D4</t>
   </list>

    <t>PCEP security mechanisms as described in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis"/>, 
    <xref target="RFC7334"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp"/> are applicable for this document.</t>
    <t>The new explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes for a subset of P2MP destination 
    defined in this document allow finer and more specific control of the path computed by a PCE.  
    Such control increases the risk if a PCEP message is intercepted, modified, or spoofed because 
    it allows the attacker to exert control over the path that the PCE will compute or to make the 
    path computation impossible.  Therefore, the security techniques described in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, 
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis"/>, <xref target="RFC7334"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp"/> are considered more important.</t>
    <t>Note, however, that the route exclusion mechanisms also provide the operator with the ability to route 
    around vulnerable parts of the network and may be used to increase overall network security.</t>
