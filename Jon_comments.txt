[[Dhruv Dhody]] Ack, and you are right and thus I combined the third point with the second.

[[Dhruv Dhody]] Since there is chance of recovery when PCE triggers synchronization, we didnâ€™t close the session. Should I make it "..MAY close the session"? 
That should work for both.

[[Dhruv Dhody]] I also do not find this useful, but Adrian specifically asked for it with this comment -  

             This is all very well for PCCs that support this I-D but don't
             want to do triggered resynch. What about a PCC that doesn't 
             even support this I-D? How will it process this PCUpd (which, 
             obviously, it should not receive)? I'm sure you can just find 
             a relevant paragraph of draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce to point 
             to.

I thought no harm done in including it.
