   <t> 
   IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element (PCE) communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages,
   objects, TLVs). IANA established a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP
   codepoints and sub-registries. The allocation policy for each new 
   registry is by IETF Review.</t>
   
   <t>This document updates RFC 5440 by changing the allocation policies 
   for these three registries to mark some of the code points as assigned
   for Experimental Use.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.</t>

   <t>Further, in order to support use cases described in <xref target="RFC8051"/>, 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce"/> specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   LSPs via PCEP. <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/> describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.</t>

   <t>In section 9 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, IANA assigns values to 
   the PCEP protocol parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). IANA established 
   a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   The allocation policy for each new registry is by IETF Review as 
   described in <xref target="RFC8126"/>. Also, early
   allocation <xref target="RFC7120"/> provides some latitude for allocation of these
   code points, but is reserved
   for features that are considered appropriately stable.</t> 
      
   <t>With some recent advancement, there is an enhanced need to 
   experiment with PCEP. It is often necessary
   to use some sort of number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment. In order to run experiments, it is important that 
   the value won't collide not only with existing codepoints but any 
   future allocation. </t>
   
   <t><!--This document thus set apart some codepoints
   in PCEP registry and subregistries for experimental usage.-->
   This document updates <xref target="RFC5440"/> by changing the allocation policies
    for these three registries to mark some of the code points as
    assigned for Experimental Use.  See <xref target="RFC3692"/> for further discussion
    of the use of experimental codepoints.

    <t><!--Some codepoints are requested to be set aside for experimentation
    with new PCEP messages. The suggested range is 246-255.-->
    	   PCEP message types are in the range 0 to 255.  This document sets
   aside message types 246-255 for experimentation as described in
   <xref target="sec_iana_msg"/>.

    <t><!--Some codepoints are requested to be set aside for experimentation
    with new PCEP objects. The suggested range is 224-255.-->
    	   PCEP objects are identified by values in the range 0 to 255.  This
   document sets aside object identifiers 224-255 for experimentation as
   described in <xref target="sec_iana_obj"/>.

<t><!--Some codepoints are requested to be set aside for experimentation

   aside object identifiers 65280-65535 for experimentation as described
   in <xref target="sec_iana_obj"/>.

<section title="Handling of Unknown Experimentation">
	<t>A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental PCEP message, that it does not recognize, would react as per section 6.9 of 
	<xref target="RFC5440"/> by sending a PCErr message with Error-value=2 (capability not supported). 
</t>
   <t>A PCE that does not recognize an experimental PCEP object, will reject the
   entire PCEP message and send a PCE error message with Error-
   Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported object" as described 
   in <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
   <t>As per section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, unknown experimental PCEP TLV would be ignored.</t>
