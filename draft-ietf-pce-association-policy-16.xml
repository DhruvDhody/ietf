    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate policies to
      a group of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path
      Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP). The extension
      allows a PCEP speaker to advertise to a PCEP peer that a particular LSP
      belongs to a particular Policy Association Group.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
      Communication Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or
      between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture <xref target="RFC4655"/>.
      <xref target="RFC5394"/> provides additional details on policy within
      the PCE architecture and also provides context for the support of PCE
      Policy.</t>

      <t>PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/>
      describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of
      Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels. <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the
      set-up and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE
      model, without the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus
      allowing for a dynamic network. Currently, the LSPs can either be
      signaled via Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
      or can be segment routed as specified in <xref target="RFC8664"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8697"/> introduces a generic mechanism to create a
      grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define associations between a
      set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or
      behaviors) and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and passive
      modes) and stateless PCE.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
      LSPs with policies using the generic association mechanism.</t>

      <t>A PCEP speaker may want to influence the PCEP peer with respect to
      path selection and other policies. This document describes a PCEP
      extension to associate policies by creating Policy Association Group
      (PAG) and encoding this association in PCEP messages. The specification
      is applicable to both stateful and stateless PCEP sessions.</t>

      <t>Note that the actual policy definition and the associated parameters
      are out of scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="Motivation" toc="default">
      <t>Paths computed using PCE can be subjected to various policies at both
      the PCE and the PCC. For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
      (TE) scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specify
      policies for traffic accounting, path monitoring, telemetry, etc., for
      some LSPs via the Stateful PCE. Similarly, a PCC could request a user-specific
      or service-specific policy to be applied at the PCE, such as constraints
      relaxation policy to meet optimal QoS and resiliency.</t>

      <t>PCEP speakers can use the generic mechanism of <xref
      target="RFC8697"/> to associate a set of LSPs with a policy, without the need to know the
   details of such a policy.  This simplifies network operations and avoids
   frequent software upgrades, as well as provides the ability to
   introduce new policies more quickly.</t>

      <section title="Policy based Constraints" toc="default">
        <t>In the context of Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework <xref
        target="RFC5394"/>, path computation policies may be applied at either a PCC or a PCE or both.
        A Label Switching Router (LSR) with a policy
        enabled PCC can receive <list style="symbols">
        <t>a service request via signaling, including
        over a Network-Network Interface (NNI) or User-Network Interface (UNI)
        reference point</t>
        <t>a configuration request over a management
        interface to establish a service</t>
      </list></t>
        <t>The PCC may apply user-specific or
        service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
        should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
        optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should be
        applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
        successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
        against network failures. The user-specific or service-specific policies
        applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
        computation request, in the form of constraints <xref
        target="RFC5394"/>.</t>

        <t>PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per <xref
        target="RFC8697"/> to associate a set of LSPs with policies and its
        resulting path computation constraints. This would simplify the path
        computation message exchanges in PCEP.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview" toc="default">
      <t>As per <xref target="RFC8697"/>, LSPs are associated with other LSPs
      with which they interact by adding them to a common association group.
      Grouping can also be used to define the association between LSPs and
      policies associated to them. As described in <xref target="RFC8697"/>,
      the association group is uniquely identified by the combination of the
      following fields in the ASSOCIATION object: Association Type,
      Association ID, Association Source, and (if present) Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID. This document defines a new
      Association type, called "Policy Association", of value 3 (early-allocated by IANA), based on the
      generic ASSOCIATION object. This new Association type is also called
      "PAT", for "Policy Association Type".</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8697"/> specifies the mechanism for the capability
      advertisement of the Association types supported by a PCEP speaker by
      defining a ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object. This
      capability exchange for the PAT MUST be done before using the
      policy association. Thus the PCEP speaker MUST include the PAT in
      the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and MUST receive the same from the PCEP peer
      before using the Policy Association Group (PAG) in PCEP messages.</t>

      <t>The Policy Association type (3) is operator-configured (as specified in <xref target="RFC8697"/>),
      i.e. the association is created by the operator manually on the PCEP
      peers and an LSP belonging to this association is conveyed via PCEP
      messages to the PCEP peer. There is no need to convey an explicit
      Operator-configured Association Range, which could only serve to
      artificially limit the available association IDs. Thus, for Policy Association type, 
      Operator-configured Association Range MUST
      NOT be set, and MUST be ignored if received.</t>

      <t>A PAG can have one or more LSPs. The association parameters including
      association identifier, Association type (PAT), as well as the
      association source IP address are manually configured by the operator and
      are used to identify the PAG as described in <xref target="RFC8697"/>.
      The Global Association Source and Extended Association ID MAY also be
      included.</t>

      <t>As per the processing rules specified in section 6.4 of <xref
      target="RFC8697"/>, if a PCEP speaker does not support this Policy
      Association type, it would return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26
      "Association Error" and Error-Value 1 "Association type is not
      supported". The PAG and the policy
      MUST be configured on the PCEP peers as per the operator-configured
      association procedures. All further processing is as per section 6.4 of
      <xref target="RFC8697"/>. If a PCE speaker receives PAG in a PCEP
      message, and the policy association information is not configured, it
      MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and
      Error-Value 4 "Association unknown". <!--If some of the 
    association information <xref target='RFC8697'/> (the TLVs defined in this document)
    received from the peer does not match the local configured values, the 
    PCEP speaker MUST reject the PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 
   "Association Error" and Error-Value 5 "Operator-configured
   association information mismatch".--></t>

      <t>Associating a particular LSP to multiple policy groups is allowed
      from a protocol perspective, however, there is no assurance that the
      PCEP speaker will be able to apply multiple policies. If a PCEP speaker
      does not support handling of multiple policies for an LSP, it MUST NOT
      add the LSP into the association group and MUST return a PCErr with
      Error- Type 26 (Association Error) and Error-value 7 (Cannot join the
      association group).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Policy Association Group" toc="default">
      <t>Association groups and their memberships are defined using the
      ASSOCIATION object defined in <xref target="RFC8697"/>. Two object types
      for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined. The ASSOCIATION object includes
      "Association type" indicating the type of the association group. This
      document add a new Association type (PAT).</t>

        <t>The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is an optional TLV that can be carried in
        ASSOCIATION object (for PAT) to carry opaque information needed to
        apply the policy at the PCEP peer. In some cases to apply a PCE policy
        successfully, it is required to also associate some policy parameters
        that need to be evaluated. This TLV is used to carry those policy
        parameters. The TLV could include one or more policy related
        parameters. The encoding format and the order MUST be known to the
        PCEP peers, this could be done during the configuration of the policy
        (and its association parameters) for the PAG. The TLV format is as per
        the format of the PCEP TLVs, as defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>,
        and shown in <xref target="fig-policy-tlv"/>. Only one

        <t>The type of the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is 48 (early-allocated by IANA) and it has a variable
        length. The Value field is variable and padded to a 4-byte alignment;
        padding is not included in the Length field. The PCEP peer
        implementation needs to be aware of the encoding format, order, and
        meaning of the 'Policy Parameters' well in advance based on the
        policy. Note that from the protocol point of view this data is opaque
        and can be used to carry parameters in any format understood by the
        PCEP peers and associated to the policy. The exact use of this TLV is
        beyond the scope of this document. Examples are included for
        illustration purposes in <xref target="example"/>.</t>

        <t>If the PCEP peer is unaware of the policy parameters associated
        with the policy and it receives the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV, it MUST
        reject the PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26
        "Association Error" and Error-Value TBD3 "Not expecting policy
        parameters". Further, if one or more parameters in the
        POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV received by the PCEP speaker are considered as
        unacceptable in the context of the associated policy (e.g., out of
        range value, badly encoded value...), the PCEP speaker MUST reject the
        PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association
        Error" and Error-Value TBD4 "Unacceptable policy parameters".</t>

        <t>Note that, the vendor-specific behavioral information is encoded in
        VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV which can be used along with this TLV.</t>

    <section anchor="Imp" title="Implementation Status">
      <t>[Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
      well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]</t>

      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
      protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
      Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref
      target="RFC7942"/>. The description of implementations in this section
      is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
      drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
      implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore,
      no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that
      was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not
      be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
      features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
      exist.</t>

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and
      working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
      benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
      experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
      more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this
      information as they see fit".</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
   <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC8697"/>, 
   <xref target="RFC8231"/>, <xref target="RFC5394"/>, and <xref target="RFC5440"/> apply to the 
   extensions described in this document as well. In particular,
   a malicious PCEP speaker could be spoofed and used as an attack vector
   by creating spurious policy associations as described in <xref target="RFC8697"/>. 
   Further as described in <xref target="RFC8697"/>, a spurious LSP can have policies that are inconsistent with those of the
   legitimate LSPs of the group and thus cause problems in handling of the policy for the
   legitimate LSPs. It should be noted that policy association could provide an adversary with the
   opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship between the LSPs. <xref target="RFC8697"/> suggest that the implementations and operators to use indirect values as a way to hide any sensitive business
   relationships. Thus, securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   <xref target="RFC8253"/>, as per the recommendations and best current practices in
   BCP 195 <xref target="RFC7525"/>, is RECOMMENDED.</t>

      <t>Further, extra care needs to be taken by the implementation with respect to
      POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding, verifying, and applying these
      policy variables. This TLV parsing could be exploited by an
      attacker and thus extra care must be taken while configuring policy association that uses POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV and making sure that the data is easy to parse and verify before use. Ensuring agreement among all
relevant PCEP peers as to the format and layout of the policy parameters information is key for the 
correct operations. Note that, the parser for POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is particularly
sensitive since it is opque to PCEP and can be used to
convey data with many different internal structure/formats. The choice of decoder is dependent on the additional metadata
associated with the policy and thus incur 
additional risk of using a wrong decoder and getting
garbage results. Use standard and well-known policy formats could help
alleviate those risks.

    <section anchor="example" title="Example of Policy Parameters"
             toc="default">
      <t>An example could be a monitoring and telemetry policy P1 that is
      dependent on a profile (GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE) as set by the operator. The
      PCEP peers need to be aware of the policy P1 (and its associated
      characteristics) in advance as well the fact that the policy parameter
      will encode the profile of type string in the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV. As
      an example, LSP1 could encode the PAG with the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV
      with a string "GOLD".</t>

      <t>Another example where the path computation at PCE could be dependent
      on when the LSP was configured at the PCC. For such a policy P2, the
      time-stamp can be encoded in the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV and the exact
      encoding could be the 64-bit timestamp format as defined in <xref
      target="RFC5905"/>.</t>

      <t>While the above example has a single field in the
      POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV, it is possible to include multiple fields, but
      the exact order, encoding format and meanings need to be known in
      advance at the PCEP peers.</t>
