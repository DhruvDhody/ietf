    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
    <t>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS), a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is used in computing
   paths for connection oriented packet services and for circuits. The
   TED contains all relevant information that a Path Computation
   Element (PCE) needs to perform its computations. It is important
   that the TED be complete and accurate each time, the PCE performs a
   path computation.</t>

   <t>In MPLS and GMPLS, interior gateway routing protocols (IGPs) have
   been used to create and maintain a copy of the TED at each node
   running the IGP. One of the benefits of the PCE architecture
   <xref target="RFC4655"/> is the use of computationally more sophisticated path
   computation algorithms and the realization that these may need
   enhanced processing power not necessarily available at each node
   participating in an IGP.</t>

   <t>Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC4655"/> describes the potential load of the TED on
   a network node and proposes an architecture where the TED is
   maintained by the PCE rather than the network nodes. However, it
   does not describe how a PCE would obtain the information needed to
   populate its TED. PCE may construct its TED by participating in the
   IGP (<xref target="RFC3630"/>  and <xref target="RFC5305"/>  for MPLS-TE; <xref target="RFC4203"/>  and <xref target="RFC5307"/>
   for GMPLS). An alternative is offered by BGP-LS <xref target="RFC7752"/> .</t>


   <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide
   stateful control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the
   information carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol
   (IGP), but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources
   for its computations. PCC can delegate the rights to modify the LSP
   parameters to an Active Stateful PCE. This requires PCE to quickly
   be updated on any changes in the Topology and TEDB, so that PCE can
   meet the need for updating LSPs effectively and in a timely manner.
   The fastest way for a PCE to be updated on TED changes is via a
   direct interface with each network node and with incremental update
   from each network node with only the attribute that is modified.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of
   PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need
   for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network that is centrally controlled and deployed. This model
   requires timely topology and TED update at the PCE. </t>

   <!--<t><xref target="I-D.leedhody-teas-pcep-ls"/> proposes some other approaches for learning and maintaining
   the Link-State and TE information directly on a PCE as an alternative to IGPs and BGP flooding
   and investigate the impact from the PCE, routing protocol, and node
   perspectives.</t>-->

   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the specifications for the Path Computation
   Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP specifies the
   communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
   Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on the PCE
   architecture <xref target="RFC4655"/>.</t>

   <t>This document describes a mechanism by which Link State and TE
   information can be collected from networks and shared with PCE
   using the PCEP itself.  This is achieved using a new PCEP message format.
   The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual links as well as
   further subjected to various policies.</t>


   <t>A network node maintains one or more databases for storing link-state
   and TE information about nodes and links in any given area.  Link attributes
   stored in these databases include: local/remote IP addresses, local/
   remote interface identifiers, link metric and TE metric, link
   bandwidth, reservable bandwidth, per CoS class reservation state,
   preemption and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG).  The node's PCEP
   process can retrieve topology from these databases and distribute
   it to a PCE, either directly or via another PCEP Speaker, using
   the encoding specified in this document.</t>

   <t>Further <xref target="RFC6805"/> describes Hierarchical-PCE architecture,
   where a parent PCE maintains a domain
   topology map. To build this domain topology map, the child PCE can carry
   the border nodes and inter-domain link information to the parent PCE using
   the mechanism described in this document. Further as described in 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-applicability-actn"/>, the 
   child PCE can also transport abstract Link-State and
   TE information from child PCE to a Parent PCE using the mechanism
   described in this document to build an abstract topology at the parent PCE.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> describe LSP
   state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs in case of stateful PCE. This
   document does not make any change to the LSP state synchronization process.
   The mechanism described in this document are on top of the existing LSP
   state synchronization.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
      <t>The terminology is as per <xref target="RFC4655"/> and <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Applicability" toc="default">

   <t>The
   mechanism specified in this draft is applicable to deployments:
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>Where there is no IGP or BGP-LS running in the network. </t>
   <t>Where there is no IGP or BGP-LS running at the PCE to learn link-state and TE information. </t>
   <t>Where there is IGP or BGP-LS running but with a need for a faster and direct TE and link-state population and convergence at the PCE.
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>A PCE may receive partial information (say basic TE, link-state) from IGP and other information (optical and impairment) from PCEP.</t>
   <t>A PCE may receive an incremental update (as opposed to the entire information of the node/link).</t>
   <t>A PCE may receive full information from both existing mechanism (IGP or BGP) and PCEP.</t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>Where there is a need for transporting (abstract) Link-State
   and TE information from child PCE to a Parent PCE in H-PCE <xref target="RFC6805"/>;
   as well as for Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) to Multi-Domain Service Coordinator
   (MDSC) in Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) <xref target="RFC8453"/>. 
   </t>
   <t>Where there is an existing PCEP session between all the nodes and the PCE-based central controller (PCECC) <xref target="RFC8283"/>, and the operator would like to use PCEP as a direct south bound interface to the all the nodes in the network. This enables operator to use PCEP as single direct protocol between the controller and all the nodes in the network. In this mode all nodes send the only local information.</t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>Based on the local policy and deployment scenario, a PCC chooses to send only local information or both local and remote learned information. </t>
   <t>How a PCE manages the link-state (and TE) information is implementation specific and thus out of scope of this document.</t>
   <t>The prefix information in PCEP-LS can also help in determining the domain of the endpoints in H-PCE (and ACTN).
   Section 4.5 of <xref target="RFC6805"/> describe various mechanism and procedures that might be used, PCEP-LS provides a simple mechanism
   to exchange this information within PCEP.  <xref target="RFC8453"/> defines three types of
   topology abstraction - (1) Native/White Topology; (2) Black Topology;
   and (3) Grey Topology.  Based on the local policy, the PNC (or child PCE) would share the domain topology to the MDSC (or Parent PCE)
   based on the abstraction type.  The protocol extension defined in this document can carry any type of topology abstraction.</t>
   

   </section>
    <section title="Requirements for PCEP extension" toc="default" anchor="sec_req">
    <t>Following key requirements associated with link-state (and TE) distribution are identified for PCEP:
    <list style="numbers">
    <t>The PCEP speaker supporting this draft MUST be a mechanism to advertise the Link-State (and TE) distribution capability.</t>
    <t>PCC supporting this draft MUST have the capability to report the link-state (and TE) information to
    the PCE. This MUST includes self originated information and also allow remote information
    learned via routing protocols. PCC MUST be capable to do the initial bulk sync at
    the time of session initialization as well as changes after.</t>

    <t>A PCE MAY learn link-state (and TE) from PCEP as well as from existing mechanism like
    IGP/BGP-LS. PCEP extension MUST have a mechanism to link the information
    learned via other means. There MUST NOT be any changes to the existing link-state (and TE)
    population mechanism
    via IGP/BGP-LS. PCEP extension SHOULD keep the properties in a
    protocol (IGP or BGP-LS) neutral way, such that an implementation
    may not need to know about any OSPF or IS-IS or BGP protocol specifics.</t>

    <t>It SHOULD be possible to encode only the changes in link-state (and TE) properties
    (after the initial sync) in PCEP messages. This leads to faster convergence. </t>

    <t>The same mechanism should be used for both MPLS TE as well as GMPLS,
    optical and impairment aware properties.</t>

    <t>The same mechanism should be used for PCE to PCE Link-state (and TE) synchronization.</t>

    <!--<t>The extension in this draft SHOULD be extensible to support various
    architecture options listed in <xref target="I-D.leedhody-teas-pcep-ls"/>.</t>-->

    </list>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="New Functions to distribute link-state (and TE) via PCEP">
   <t>Several new functions are required in PCEP to support distribution
   of link-state (and TE) information. A function can be initiated
   either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards a PCC (E-C).
    The new functions are:
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>Capability advertisement (E-C,C-E): both the PCC and the PCE MUST announce during PCEP session establishment that they support PCEP extensions for distribution of link-state (and TE) information defined in this document.</t>

   <t>Link-State (and TE) synchronization (C-E): after the session between the PCC and a PCE is initialized, the PCE must learn Link-State (and TE) information before it can perform path computations.  In case of stateful PCE it is RECOMENDED that this operation be done before LSP state synchronization.</t>

   <t>Link-State (and TE) Report (C-E): a PCC sends a LS (and TE) report to a PCE whenever the Link-State and TE information changes.</t>
   </list> </t>
    </section>



    <section title="Overview of Extension to PCEP" toc="default" anchor="sec_overview">
     <section title="New Messages">
   <t>In this document, we define a new PCEP messages called LS Report (LSRpt),
      a PCEP message sent by a PCC
      to a PCE to report link-state (and TE) information.  Each LS Report in a LSRpt message can contain
      the node or link properties. An unique PCEP specific LS identifier (LS-ID) is
      also carried in the message to identify a node or link and that remains constant for the
      lifetime of a PCEP session. This identifier on its own is sufficient
      when no IGP or BGP-LS running in the network for PCE to learn link-state (and TE) information.
      In case PCE learns some information from PCEP and some
      from the existing mechanism, the PCC SHOULD include the mapping of IGP or BGP-LS
      identifier to map the information populated via PCEP with IGP/BGP-LS.
      See <xref target="sec_lsrpt"/> for details.</t>

      </section>
     <section title="Capability Advertisement">
     <t>During PCEP Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC)
   advertise their support of LS (and TE) distribution via PCEP extensions.  A PCEP Speaker
   includes the "LS Capability" TLV, described in <xref target="sec_ls_tlv"/>,
   in the OPEN Object to advertise its support for PCEP-LS extensions.
   The presence of the LS Capability TLV in PCC's OPEN Object
   indicates that the PCC is willing to send LS Reports whenever
   local link-state (and TE) information changes. The presence of the
   LS Capability TLV in PCE's OPEN message
   indicates that the PCE is interested in receiving LS Reports
   whenever local link-state (and TE) information changes.</t>
   <t>The PCEP extensions for LS (and TE) distribution MUST NOT be used if
   one or both PCEP Speakers have not included the LS
   Capability TLV in their respective OPEN message. If the PCE that
   supports the extensions of this draft but did not advertise this
   capability, then upon receipt of a LSRpt message from the PCC, it
   SHOULD generate a PCErr with error-type 19 (Invalid Operation),
   error-value TBD1 (Attempted LS Report if LS
   capability was not advertised) and it will
   terminate the PCEP session.</t>
   <t>The LS reports sent by PCC MAY carry the remote link-state (and TE) information
   learned via existing means like IGP and BGP-LS
   only if both PCEP Speakers set the R (remote) Flag in the
   "LS Capability" TLV to 'Remote Allowed (R Flag = 1)'.  If this
   is not the case and LS reports carry remote link-state (and TE) information, then a
   PCErr with error-type 19 (Invalid Operation) and
   error-value TBD1 (Attempted LS Report if LS
   remote capability was not advertised) and it will
   terminate the PCEP session.</t>

      </section>
     <section title="Initial Link-State (and TE) Synchronization">
     <t>The purpose of LS Synchronization is to provide a checkpoint-in-
   time state replica of a PCC's link-state (and TE) data base in a PCE. State
   Synchronization is performed immediately after the Initialization
   phase (see <xref target="RFC5440"/>). In case of stateful PCE
   (<xref target="RFC8231"/>)
   it is RECOMENDED that the LS synchronization should be done
   before LSP state synchronization.</t>

   <t>During LS Synchronization, a PCC first takes a snapshot of the
   state of its database, then sends the snapshot to a PCE in a
   sequence of LS Reports.  Each LS Report sent during
   LS Synchronization has the SYNC Flag in the LS Object set to 1.
   The end of synchronization marker is a LSRpt message with the SYNC
   Flag set to 0 for an LS Object with LS-ID equal to the reserved
   value 0. If the
   PCC has no link-state to synchronize, it will only send the end of
   synchronization marker.</t>

   <t>Either the PCE or the PCC MAY terminate the session using the PCEP
   session termination procedures during the synchronization phase.  If
   the session is terminated, the PCE MUST clean up state it received
   from this PCC.  The session re-establishment MUST be re-attempted per
   the procedures defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, including use of a back-off
   timer.</t>

   <t>If the PCC encounters a problem which prevents it from completing the
   LS synchronization, it MUST send a PCErr message with error-type TBD2 (LS
   Synchronization Error) and error-value 2 (indicating an
   internal PCC error) to the PCE and terminate the session.</t>

   <t>The PCE does not send positive acknowledgments for properly received
   LS synchronization messages.  It MUST respond with a PCErr message with
   error-type TBD2 (LS Synchronization Error) and error-value 1
   (indicating an error in processing the LSRpt) if it
   encounters a problem with the LS Report it received from the
   PCC and it MUST terminate the session.</t>

   <t>The LS reports can carry local as well as remote link-state (and TE) information depending on the R flag in LS capability
      TLV.</t>

   <t>The successful LS Synchronization sequences is shown in <xref target="F1"/>.</t>

      <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made of a set of objects that can
   be either mandatory or optional.  An object is said to be mandatory
   in a PCEP message when the object must be included for the message to
   be considered valid.  For each PCEP message type, a set of rules is
   defined that specify the set of objects that the message can carry.
   An implementation MUST form the PCEP messages using the object
   ordering specified in this document.</t>
      <section title="LS Report Message" anchor="sec_lsrpt">
      <t>A PCEP LS Report message (also referred to as

   Reports.  The Message-Type field of the PCEP common header

   <section title="Virtual Network TLV">
    <t>To realize ACTN, the MDSC needs to build an multi-domain topology.
    This topology is best served, if this is an abstracted view of the 
    underlying network resources of each domain. It is also important 
    to provide a customer view of network slice for each customer.
    There is a need to control the level of abstraction based on 
   the deployment scenario and business relationship between the controllers. 
   </t>   
   <t>Virtual service coordination function in ACTN incorporates customer
   service-related knowledge into the virtual network operations in
   order to seamlessly operate virtual networks while meeting customer's
   service requirements. <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-requirements"/> describes various VN operations
   initiated by a customer/application. In this context, there is a
   need for associating the abstracted link state and TE topology with a VN "construct" to
   facilitate VN operations in PCE architecture.</t>
   <t>VIRTUAL-NETWORK-TLV as per <xref target="I-D.leedhody-pce-vn-association"/>

   Router-ID for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  In case of additional auxiliary
   Router-IDs used for TE, these MUST also be included in the link
   attribute TLV (see <xref target="link_attr"/>).</t>

   <t>It is desirable that the Router-ID assignments inside the Node
   Descriptor are globally unique. Some considerations for globally
   unique Node/Link/Prefix identifiers are described in

   <t>The Local Node Descriptors TLV contains Node Descriptors for the node
   anchoring the local end of the link.  This TLV MUST be included in the LS Report

   A PCC sends to a PCE the first LS Report either during State
   Synchronization, or when a new node/link/prefix is learned at the PCC.
   The value

      <t>One of a key objective of PCEP-LS is to encode
      and carry only the impacted attributes of a Node, a Link or a Prefix. 
      To accommodate this requirement, in case of a removal of an attribute,
      the sub-TLV MUST be included with no 'value' field and length=0 
      to indicate that the attribute is removed. On receiving a sub-TLV
      with zero length, the receiver removes the attribute from the database. An absence of a sub-TLV that was included earlier MUST be interpreted as no change.</t>

   <t>The main source of LS (and TE) information is the IGP, which is not active on
   inter-AS links.  In some cases, the IGP may have information of
   inter-AS links (<xref target="RFC5392"/>, <xref target="RFC5316"/>).  In other cases, an
   implementation SHOULD provide a means to inject inter-AS links into
   PCEP.  The exact mechanism used to provision the inter-AS links is
   outside the scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>This document extends PCEP for LS (and TE) distribution including a new
      LSRpt message with new object and TLVs. Procedures and protocol extensions
      defined in this document do not effect the overall PCEP security model.
      See <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref target="RFC8253"/>.
      Tampering with the LSRpt message
      may have an effect on path computations at PCE. It also provides adversaries
      an opportunity to eavesdrop and learn sensitive information and plan
      sophisticated attacks on the network infrastructure. The PCE implementation
      SHOULD provide mechanisms to prevent strains created by network flaps and
      amount of LS (and TE) information. Thus it is suggested
      that any mechanism used for securing the transmission of other PCEP
      message be applied here as well. As a general precaution, it is
      RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions only be activated on
      authenticated and encrypted sessions belonging to the same
      administrative authority.</t>
                 <t>Further, as stated in <xref target="RFC6952"/>, PCEP implementations SHOULD support the
   TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5925"/> and not use TCP MD5 because of TCP MD5's known
   vulnerabilities and weakness. PCEP also support Transport Layer Security (TLS)

    <section title="Implementation Status">
      <t>The PCEP-LS protocol extension as described in this I-D
   were implemented and tested for a variety of applications. Apart from the below implementation, there exist other experimental implementations done for optical networks.</t>

    <section title="Hierarchical Transport PCE controllers">
    <t>The PCEP-LS has been implemented as part of IETF97 Hackathon and Bits-N-Bites demonstration. The use-case demonstrated was DCI use-case of ACTN architecture in which to show the following scenarios:
      <list>
        <t>- connectivity services on the ACTN based recursive hierarchical SDN/PCE platform that has the three tier level SDN controllers (two-tier level MDSC and PNC) on the top of the PTN systems managed by EMS. </t>
        <t>- Integration test of two tier-level MDSC: The SBI of the low level MDSC is the YANG based Korean national standards and the one of the high level MDSC the PCEP-LS based ACTN protocols.</t>
        <t>- Performance test of three types of SDN controller based recovery schemes including protection, reactive and proactive restoration. PCEP-LS protocol was used to demonstrate quick report of failed network components. </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="ONOS-based Controller (MDSC and PNC)">

    <t>Huawei (PNC, MDSC) and SKT (MDSC) implemented PCEP-LS during Hackathon and IETF97 Bits-N-Bites demonstration. The demonstration was ONOS-based ACTN architecture in which to show the following
   capabilities:
     <list>
      <t>Both packet PNC and optical PNC (with optical PCEP-LS extension) implemented PCEP-LS on its SBI and well as its NBI (towards MDSC).</t>
      <t>SKT orchestrator (acting as MDSC) also supported PCEP-LS (as well as RestConf) towards packet and optical PNCs on its SBI.</t>
