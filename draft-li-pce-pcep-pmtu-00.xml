    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
      functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</t>

      <t>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture
      describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through
      an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm. A Segment
      Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an
      IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path
      Computation Element (PCE).</t>

      <t>Since the SR does not require signaling, the path maximum
      transmission unit (MTU) information for SR path is not available. This
      document specify the extension to PCE communication protocol (PCEP) to
      carry path (MTU) in the PCEP messages.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
      purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE
      LSP) characteristics.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
      enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
      compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to
      effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref
      target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t>As per <xref target="RFC8402"/>, with Segment
      Routing (SR), a node steers a packet through an ordered list of
      instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction,
      topological or service-based. A segment can have a semantic local to an
      SR node or global within an SR domain. SR allows to enforce a flow
      through any path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only
      at the ingress node of the SR domain. Segments can be derived from
      different components: IGP, BGP, Services, Contexts, Locators, etc. The
      SR architecture can be applied to the MPLS forwarding plane without any
      change, in which case an SR path corresponds to an MPLS Label Switching
      Path (LSP). The SR is applied to IPV6 forwarding plane using SRH. A SR
      path can be derived from an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), but SR-TE
      paths may not follow IGP SPT. Such paths may be chosen by a suitable
      network planning tool, or a PCE and provisioned on the ingress node.</t>

      <t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>, it is possible
      to use a stateful PCE for computing one or more SR-TE paths taking into
      account various constraints and objective functions. Once a path is
      chosen, the stateful PCE can initiate an SR-TE path on a PCC using PCEP
      extensions specified in <xref target="RFC8281"/> using the SR specific
      PCEP extensions specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies PCEP extensions for
      supporting a SR-TE LSP for MPLS data plane. <xref
      target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> extend PCEP to support SR
      for IPv6 data plane.</t>

      <t>The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size packet or
      frame, in bytes, that can be sent in a network. An MTU that is too large
      might cause retransmissions. Too small an MTU might cause the router to
      send and handle relatively more header overhead and acknowledgments.
      When an LSP is created across a set of links with different MTU sizes,
      the ingress router need to know what the smallest MTU is on the LSP
      path. If this MTU is larger than the MTU of one of the intermediate
      links, traffic might be dropped, because MPLS packets cannot be
      fragmented. Also, the ingress router may not be aware of this type of
      traffic loss, because the control plane for the LSP would still function
      normally. <xref target="RFC3209"/> specify the mechanism of MTU
      signaling in RSVP.</t>

      <t>Since the SR does not require signaling, the path MTU information for
      SR path is not available. This document specify the extension to PCEP to
      carry path MTU in the PCEP messages. It is assumed that the PCE is aware
      of the link MTU as part of the Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
      population. This could be done via IGP, BGP-LS or some other means. Thus
      the PCE can find the path MTU at the time of path computation and
      include this information as part of the PCEP messages.</t>

      <t>Though the key use case for path MTU is SR, the PCEP extension (as
      specified in this document) creates a new metric type for path MTU,
      making this a generic extension that can be used independent of SR.</t>

      <section title="Extensions to METRIC Object" toc="default">
        <t>The METRIC object is defined in Section 7.8 of <xref
        target="RFC5440"/>, comprising metric-value and metric-type (T field),
        and a flags field, comprising a number of bit flags (B bit and C bit).
        This document defines a new type for the METRIC object for Path
        MTU.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>T = TBD: Path MTU.</t>

            <t>A network comprises of a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.</t>

            <t>A path P of a LSP is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.</t>

            <t>A Link MTU of link L is denoted M(L).</t>

            <t>A Path MTU metric for the path P = Min {M(Lpi), (i=1...K)}.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Path MTU metric type of the METRIC object in PCEP represents
        the minimum of the Link MTU of all links along the path.</t>

        <t>When PCE computes the path, it can also find the Path MTU (based on
        the above criteria) and include this information in the METRIC object
        with the above metric type in the PCEP message when replying to the
        PCC. In a Path Computation Reply (PCRep) message, the PCE MAY insert
        the METRIC object with an Explicit Route Object (ERO) so as to provide
        the METRIC (path MTU) for the computed path. The PCE MAY also insert
        the METRIC object with a NO-PATH object to indicate that the metric
        constraint could not be satisfied.</t>

        <t>Further, a PCC MAY use the Path MTU metric in a Path Computation
        Request (PCReq) message to request a path meeting the MTU requirement
        of the path. In this case, the B bit MUST be set to suggest a bound (a
        maximum) for the Path MTU metric that must not be exceeded for the PCC
        to consider the computed path as acceptable. The Path MTU metric must
        be less than or equal to the value specified in the metric-value
        field.</t>

        <t>A PCC can also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize the path MTU
        during path computation. In this case, the B bit MUST be cleared.</t>

        <t>The error handling and processing of the METRIC object is as
        specified in <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Stateful PCE and PCE Initiated LSPs" toc="default">
        <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
        enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP and the
        maintaining of these LSPs at the stateful PCE. It further
        distinguishes between an active and a passive stateful PCE. A passive
        stateful PCE uses LSP state information learned from PCCs to optimize
        path computations but does not actively update LSP state. In contrast,
        an active stateful PCE utilizes the LSP delegation mechanism to update
        LSP parameters in those PCCs that delegated control over their LSPs to
        the PCE. <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup, maintenance,
        and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model. The
        document defines the PCInitiate message that is used by a PCE to
        request a PCC to set up a new LSP.</t>

        <t>The new metric type defined in this document can also be used with
        the stateful PCE extensions. The format of PCEP messages described in
        <xref target="RFC8231"/> and <xref target="RFC8281"/> uses
        &lt;intended-attribute-list&gt; and &lt;attribute-list&gt;,
        respectively, (where the &lt;intended-attribute-list&gt; is the
        attribute-list defined in Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

        <t>A PCE MAY include the path MTU metric in PCInitiate or PCUpd
        message to inform the PCC of the path MTU calculated for the path. A
        PCC MAY include the path MTU metric as a bound constraint or to
        indicate optimization criteria (similar to PCReq).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Segement Routing" toc="default">
        <t>A Segment Routed path (SR path) can be derived from an IGP Shortest
        Path Tree (SPT). Segment Routed Traffic Engineering paths (SR-TE
        paths) may not follow IGP SPT. Such paths may be chosen by a suitable
        network planning tool and provisioned on the source node of the SR-TE
        path.</t>

        <t>It is possible to use a PCE for computing one or more SR-TE paths
        taking into account various constraints and objective functions. Once
        a path is chosen, the PCE can inform an SR-TE path on a PCC using PCEP
        extensions specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>.
        Further, <xref target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> adds the
        support for IPv6 data plane in SR.</t>

        <t>The new metric type for path MTU is applicable for the SR-TE path
        and require no additional extensions.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>This document defines a new METRIC type that do not add any new
      security concerns beyond those discussed in <xref target="RFC5440"/> in
      itself. Some deployments may find the path MTU information to be extra
      sensitive and could be used to influence path computation and setup with
      adverse effect. Additionally, snooping of PCEP messages with such data
      or using PCEP messages for network reconnaissance may give an attacker
      sensitive information about the operations of the network. Thus, such
      deployment should employ suitable PCEP security mechanisms like TCP
      Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925"/> or Transport
      Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8253"/>. The procedure based on
      TLS is considered a security enhancement and thus is much better suited
      for the sensitive information.</t>
