The Use Cases for Path Computation Element (PCE) as a Central Controller
                                (PCECC).

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.  PCE was developed to
   derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied
   to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP).

   SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function
   Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network.  It
   is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for
   use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a
   central controller.

   This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment
   and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its
   challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCEP
   extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate
   documents.

1.  Introduction

   An Architecture for Use of PCE and PCEP in a Network with Central
   Control [RFC8283] describes SDN architecture where the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) determines paths for variety of diferent
   usecases, with PCEP as a general southbound communication protocol
   with all the nodes along the path..

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] introduces the
   procedures and extensions for PCEP to support the PCECC architecture
   [RFC8283].

   This draft describes the various usecases for the PCECC architecture.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2018


   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCECC:  PCE as a central controller.  Extension of PCE to support SDN
      functions as per [RFC8283].

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

3.  Application Scenarios

   In the following sections, several use cases are described,
   showcasing scenarios that benefit from the deployment of PCECC.

3.1.  Use Cases of PCECC for Label Management

   As per [RFC8283], in some cases, the PCE-based controller can take
   responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS label space for
   each of the routers that it controls, and it may taker wider
   responsibility for partitioning the label space for each router and
   allocating different parts for different uses, communicating the
   ranges to the router using PCEP.

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] describe a mode
   where LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop
   on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told what
   label forwarding instructions to program and what resources to
   reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP.  For this to work, the PCE-
   based controller will take responsibility for managing some part of
   the MPLS label space for each of the routers that it controls.  An
   extention to PCEP could be done to allow a PCC to inform the PCE of
   such a label space to control.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to PCEP that
   allow a stateful PCE to compute, update or initiate SR-TE paths.
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] describes the
   mechanism for PCECC to allocate and provision the node/prefix/
   adjacency label (SID) via PCEP.  To make such allocation PCE needs to
   be aware of the label space from Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB)
   or Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB) [RFC8402] of the node that it
   controls.  A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of such a label
   space to control is needed within PCEP.  The full SRGB/SRLB of a node
   could be learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism too.

   [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space] defines a PCEP extention to support
   advertisement of the MPLS label space to the PCE to control.

   There have been various proposals for Global Labels, the PCECC
   architecture could be used as means to learn the label space of
   nodes, and could also be used to determine and provision the global
   label range.

   o  PCC would advertise the PCECC capability to the PCE (central
      controller-PCECC)
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   o  The PCECC could also learn the label range set aside by the PCC
      ([I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space]).

   o  Optionally, the PCECC could determine the shared MPLS global label
      range for the network.

      o  In the case that the shared global label range need to be
         negotiated across multiple domains, the central controllers of
         these domains would also need to negotiate a common global
         label range across domains.

      o  The PCECC would need to set the shared global label range to
         all PCC nodes in the network.

3.2.  Using PCECC for SR

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Using
   SR, a source node steers a packet through a path without relying on
   hop-by-hop signaling protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is
   specified as an ordered list of instructions called "segments".  Each
   segment is an instruction to route the packet to a specific place in
   the network, or to perform a specific service on the packet.  A
   database of segments can be distributed through the network using a
   routing protocol (such as IS-IS or OSPF) or by any other means.  PCEP
   (and PCECC) could be one such means.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specify the SR specific PCEP
   extensions.  PCECC may further use PCEP protocol for SR SID (Segment
   Identifier) distribution to the SR nodes (PCC) with some benefits.
   If the PCECC allocates and maintains the SID in the network for the
   nodes and adjacencies; and further distributes them to the SR nodes
   directly via the PCEP session has some advantage over the
   configurations on each SR node and flooding via IGP, especially in a
   SDN environment.

   When the PCECC is used for the distribution of the node segment ID
   and adjacency segment ID, the node segment ID is allocated from the
   SRGB of the node.  For the allocation of adjacency segment ID, the
   allocation is from the SRLB of the node as described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   [RFC8355] identifies various protection and resiliency usecases for
   SR.  Path protection lets the ingress node be in charge of the
   failure recovery (used for SR-TE).  Also protection can be performed
   by the node adjacent to the failed component, commonly referred to as
   local protection techniques or fast-reroute (FRR) techniques.  In
   case of PCECC, the protection paths can be pre-computated and setup
   by the PCE.

   The following example illustrate the use case where the node SID and
   adjacency SID are allocated by the PCECC.

3.2.1.  PCECC SID Allocation

   Each node (PCC) is allocated a node-SID by the PCECC.  The PCECC
   needs to update the label map of each node to all the nodes in the
   domain.  On receiving the label map, each node (PCC) uses the local
   routing information to determine the next-hop and download the label
   forwarding instructions accordingly.  The forwarding behavior and the
   end result is same as IGP based Node-SID in SR.  Thus, from anywhere
   in the domain, it enforces the ECMP-aware shortest-path forwarding of
   the packet towards the related node.

   For each adjacency in the network, PCECC can allocate an Adj-SID.
   The PCECC sends PCInitiate message to update the label map of each
   Adj to the corresponding nodes in the domain.  Each node (PCC)
   download the label forwarding instructions accordingly.  The
   forwarding behavior and the end result is similar to IGP based "Adj-
   SID" in SR.

   The various mechanism are described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

3.2.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Best Effort(BE) Path

   In this mode of the solution, the PCECC just need to allocate the
   node segment ID and adjacency ID (without calculating the explicit
   path for the SR path).  The ingress of the forwarding path just need
   to encapsulate the destination node segment ID on top of the packet.
   All the intermediate nodes will forward the packet based on the
   destination node SID.  It is similar to the LDP LSP.

   R1 may send a packet to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008} (Node SID for R8).  The path would be the based
   on the routing/nexthop calculation on the routers.

3.2.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Traffic Engineering (TE) Path

   SR-TE paths may not follow an IGP SPT.  Such paths may be chosen by a
   PCECC and provisioned on the ingress node of the SR-TE path.  The SR
   header consists of a list of SIDs (or MPLS labels).  The header has
   all necessary information so that, the packets can be guided from the
   ingress node to the egress node of the path; hence, there is no need
   for any signaling protocol.  For the case where strict traffic
   engineering path is needed, all the adjacency SID are stacked,
   otherwise a combination of node-SID or adj-SID can be used for the
   SR-TE paths.

   Note that the bandwidth reservations is only guaranteed through the
   enforce of the bandwidth admission control.  As for the RSVP-TE LSP
   case, the control plane signaling also does the link bandwidth
   reservation in each hop of the path.

   The SR traffic engineering path examples are explained as bellow:

   Note that the node SID for each node is allocated from the SRGB and
   adjacency SID for each link are allocated from the SRLB for each
   node.

   Example 1:

   R1 may send a packet P1 to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008}.  Based on the best path, it could be:
   R1-R2-R3-R8.

   Example 2:

   R1 may send a packet P2 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
   list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-(1)link-R3-R8.

   Example 3:

   R1 may send a packet P3 to R8 via R4 by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1004, 1008}.  The path could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8

   The local protection examples for SR TE path are explained as below:

   Example 4: local link protection:

   o  R1 may send a packet P4 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-(1)link-R3-R8.

   o  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      R2-(1)link-R3-R8, and also find out there is a link failure of
      link1, then the R2 can enforce the traffic over the bypass to send
      out the packet with header of R3-R8 through link2.

   Example 5: local node protection:

   o  R1 may send a packet P5 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1004, 1008}.  The path should be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8.

   o  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      {1004, 1008}, and also find out there is a node failure for node4,
      then it can enforce the traffic over the bypass and send out the
      packet with header of {1005, 1008} to node5 instead of node4.

3.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for TE LSP

   In the previous sections, we have discussed the cases where the SR
   path is setup through the PCECC.  Although those cases give the
   simplicity and scalability, but there are existing functionalities
   for the traffic engineering path such as the bandwidth guarantee,
   monitoring where SR based solution are complex.  Also there are cases
   where the depth of the label stack is an issue for existing
   deployment and certain vendors.

   So to address these issues, PCECC architecture also support the TE
   LSP functionalities.  To achieve this, the existing PCEP can be used
   to communicate between the PCECC and nodes along the path.  This is
   similar to static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as explicit
   label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router
   along the path must be told what label- forwarding instructions to
   program and what resources to reserve.  The PCE-based controller
   keeps a view of the network and determines the paths of the end-to-
   end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to communicate with each
   router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   o  Based on path computation request / delegation or PCE initiation,
      the PCECC receives the PCECC request with constraints and
      optimization criteria.

   o  PCECC would calculate the optimal path according to given
      constrains (i.e.bandwidth).

   o  PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
      and outgoing labels from R1 to R8 with the path: {R1, link1,
      6001}, {R2, link3, 7002], {R4, link0, 9001}, {R3, link1, 3001},
      {R8}.

   o  For the end to end protection, PCECC program each node along the
      path from R1 to R8 with the secondary path: {R1, link2, 6002},
      {R2, link4, 7001], {R5, link1, 9002}, {R3, link2, 3002}, {R8}.

   o  It is also possible to have a secondary backup path for the local
      node protection setup by PCECC.  For example, the primary path is
      still same as what we have setup so far, then to protect the node
      R4 locally, PCECC can program the secondary path like this: {R1,
      link1, 6001}, {R2, link1, 5001}, {R3, link1, 3001}, {R8}. By doing
      this, the node R4 is locally protected.

3.3.1.  PCECC Load Balancing (LB) Use Case

   Very often many service providers use TE tunnels for solving issues
   with non-deterministic paths in their networks.  One example of such
   applications is usage of TEs in the mobile backhaul (MBH).  Let's
   consider the following typical topology.

                              TE1 -------------->
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
| Access  |----| Access |----| AGG 1  |----| AGG N-1|----|Core 1|--|SR1|
| SubNode1|    | Node 1 |    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
+---------+    +--------+         | |           | ^          |
     |   Access    |    Access    | AGG Ring 1  | |          |
     |  SubRing 1  |    Ring 1    | |           | |          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+         | |          |
| Access  |    | Access |    | AGG 2  |         | |          |
| SubNode2|    | Node 2 |    +--------+         | |          |
+---------+    +--------+         | |           | |          |
     |             |              | |           | |          |
     |             |              | +----TE2----|-+          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
| Access  |    | Access |----| AGG 3  |----| AGG N  |----|Core N|--|SRn|
| SubNodeN|----| Node N |    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
+---------+    +--------+

   This MBH architecture uses L2 access rings and subrings.  L3 starts
   at aggregation.  For the sake of simplicity here we have only one
   access subring,access ring and aggregation ring (AGG1...AGGN),
   connected by Nx10GE interfaces.  Aggregation domain runs its own IGP.
   There are two Egress routers (AGG N-1,AGG N) that are connected to
   the Core domain via L2 interfaces.  Core also have connections to
   service routers, RSVP TEs are used for MPLS transport inside the
   ring.  There could be at least 2 tunnels (one way) from each AGG
   router to egress AGG routers.  There are also many L2 access rings
   connected to AGG routers.

   Service deployment made by means of either L2VPNs (VPLS) or L3VPNs.
   Those services use MPLS TE as transport towards egress AGG routers.
   TE tunnels could be also used as transport towards service routers in
   case of seamless MPLS based architecture in the future.

   There is a need to solve the following tasks:

   o  Perform automatic LB amongst TE tunnels according to current
      traffic load

   o  TE bandwidth (BW) management: Provide guaranteed BW for specific
      service: HSI,IPTV, etc., provide time-based BW reservation (BoD)

   o  Simplify development of TE tunnels (go away from manual
      provisioning)

   o  Provide flexibility for Service Router placement (anywhere in the
      network by creation of transport LSPs to them).

   Since other tasks are considered in other PCECC use cases above,
   hereafter we will focus only on load balancing (LB) task.  LB task
   could be solved by means of PCECC in the following way:

   o  After application or network service or operator will ask SDN
      controller (PCECC) for LSP based LB between AGG X and AGG N/AGG
      N-1 (egress AGG routers which have connections to core) via North
      Bound Interface (NBI such as REST API), PCECC SHOULD ask for
      constrains for that particular calculation (i.e.  LSP type:
      traditional CR-LSP or SR-TE LSP, bandwidth, inclusion or exclusion
      specific links or nodes, number of paths, shortest path or minimum
      cost tree, need for disjoint LSP paths etc.).

   o  PCECC MUST calculate N P2P LSPs according to given constrains,
      calculation is based on results of Objective Function (OF), that
      includes same source and destination routers IDs, same or
      different bandwidth (BW) , different links (in case of disjoint
      paths) and other constrains from Step 1.

   o  Depending on given LSP type (CR-LSP or SR-TE), PCECC SHOULD create
      different labels (aka different label spaces, it MAY also require
      label space negotiation procedure between PCECC and PCCs
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]) for calculated
      LSPs from egress nodes AGG N-1 and AGG N towards ingress AGG X
      node.

   o  PCECC SHOULD send PCInitiate PCEP message [RFC8281] towards
      ingress AGG X router(PCC) for each of N LSPs and receives PCRpt
      PCEP message [RFC8231] back from him.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2018


   o  If LSP type is CR-LSP, PCECC MUST send PCLabelUpd
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] PCEP message to
      each node along the path with label information for each of N
      LSPs.  If LSP type is SR-TE, PCECC also MUST send PCLabelUpd PCEP
      message to each node along the path with label information (Node-
      ID and Adjacency-ID segment (label) list) specific to that node.
      Then PCECC SHOULD send PCUpd PCEP message to the ingress AGG X
      router with information about new LSP and AGG X(PCC) SHOULD send
      PCEP PCRpt back with LSP status:Up.

   o  Now each router along the LSP has corresponding label forwarding
      state for each of N LSPs.

   o  AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG
      N-1674 which are available for installing to router's RIB and LB
      of traffic between them.  Traffic distribution between those LSPs
      depends on particular realization of hash-function on that router.

   o  Since PCECC MUST know as LSDB as TEDB (TE state) he can manage and
      prevent possible oversubscriptions and limit number of available
      LB states.

3.3.2.  PCECC and Inter-AS TE

   There are three signalling options for establishing Inter-AS TE LSP:
   contiguous TE LSP [RFC5151], stitched inter-AS TE LSP [RFC5150],
   nested TE LSP [RFC4206].

   Requirements for PCE-based Inter-AS setup [RFC5376] describe the
   approach and PCEP fucntionality that are needed for establishing
   Inter-AS TE LSPs.

   [RFC5376] also gives Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model that is
   provided below in shorten form for the sake of simplicity.

    Shorten form of Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model [RFC5376]

   Hereatfter we will discuss a simplified Inter-AS case when both AS1
   and AS2 belong to the same service provider administration.  In that
   case Inter and Intra-AS PCEs could be combined in one single PCE if
   such combined PCE performance is enough for handling all Path
   Computation Requests.  Even more in that particular case we
   potentially could use single PCE for both ASes if his scalability and
   performance are enough, we just will need interfaces (PCEP and BGP-
   LS) to both domains.  SDN controller's redundancy mechanisms are out
   of scope in our case.  Thus routers in AS1 and AS2 (PCCs) will send
   Path Computation Requests towards same PCE.

   In one particular case of PCECC Inter-AS TE scenario service provider
   controls both domains (AS1 and AS2), each of them have own IGP and
   MPLS transport.  The need is to setup Inter-AS LSPs for transporting
   different services on top of them (Voice,L3 VPN etc.)  Inter-AS links
   with different capacity exist in several regions.  The task is not
   only to provision those Inter-AS LSPs with given constrains but also
   calculate the path and pre-setup the backup Inter-AS LSPs that will
   be used if main LSP fails.

   For the figure above it would be that LSP1 from R1 to R3 SHOULD go
   via ASBR1 and ASBR3, and it is the main Inter-AS LSP.  R1-R3 LSP2
   that SHOULD go via ASBR5 and ASBR6 is the backup one.  Depending on
   Inter-AS TE type, backup LSP could be used either by head-end R1 or
   ASBR1.

   After the addition of PCECC functionality to PCE (SDN controller),
   PCECC based Inter-AS TE model SHOULD follow as PCECC usecase for TE
   LSP (case 6 above) as requirements of [RFC5376] with the following
   details:

   o  Since PCECC MUST know the topology of both domains AS1 and AS2,
      PCECC MUST establish BGP-LS peering with routers (or RRs) in both
      domains

   o  PCECC MUST have SBI (PCEP) connectivity towards all routers in
      both domains (see also section 4 in [RFC5376])

   o  After operator's application or service orchetsrator will create
      request for topology of specific service, PCECC SHOULD receive
      that request via NBI (NBI type is implementation dependent, MAY be
      NETCONF/Yang, REST etc.).  Then PCECC SHOULD calculate Objective
      Function (OF) for optimal path with given constrains (i.e.  LSP
      type, bandwidth etc.), including those from [RFC5376]: priority,
      AS sequence, preffered ASBR, disjoint paths, protection.  On this
      step we would have two paths: R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3

   o  Depending on given LSP type (CR-LSP or SR-TE), PCECC SHOULD create
      different labels (aka different label spaces, it MAY also require
      label space negotiation procedure between PCECC and PCCs) for
      calculated LSPs from egress node in one AS towards ingress in
      another AS.

   o  PCECC SHOULD send PCInitiate PCEP message [RFC8281] towards
      ingress router R1 (PCC) in AS1 and receive PCRpt PCEP message
      [RFC8231] back from him.

   o  If LSP type is CR-LSP, PCECC"> MUST send PCLabelUpd
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] PCEP message to

      each node along the path (ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, ASBR5-ASBR6-R3) in both
      ASes with label information for that LSP.  If LSP type is SR-TE,
      PCECC also MUST send PCLabelUpd PCEP message to each node along
      the path in aboth Ases with label information (Node-ID and
      Adjacency-ID segment (label) list) specific to that node.

   o  Then PCECC SHOULD send PCUpd PCEP message to the ingress router R1
      in AS1 with information about new LSP and the R1 router SHOULD
      send PCEP PCRpt back with LSP1 and LSP2 status:Up.

   o  After that step R1 SHOULD have main and backup TEs (LSP1 and LSP2)
      towards R3 up.  It is up to implementation how to put this TEs to
      R1's RIB and how to make switchover to backup LSP2 if LSP1 fails.

3.4.  Use Cases of PCECC for Multicast LSPs

   The current multicast LSPs are setup either using the RSVP-TE P2MP or
   mLDP protocols.  The setup of these LSPs not only need a lot of
   manual configurations, but also it is also complex when the
   protection is considered.  By using the PCECC solution, the multicast
   LSP can be computed and setup through centralized controller which
   has the full picture of the topology and bandwidth usage for each
   link.  It not only reduces the complex configurations comparing the
   distributed RSVP-TE P2MP or mLDP signal lings, but also it can
   compute the disjoint primary path and secondary path efficiently.

3.4.1.  Using PCECC for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs' Setup

   With the capability of global label and local label existing at the
   same time in the PCECC network, PCECC will use compute, setup and
   maintain the P2MP and MP2MP lsp using the local label range for each
   network nodes.

   The P2MP examples are explained here:

   Step1: R1 may send a packet P1 to R2 simply by pushing an label of
   6000 to the packet.

   Step2: After R2 receives the packet with label 6000, it will
   forwarding to R4 by pushing header of 9001 and R5 by pusing header of
   9002.

   Step3: After R4 receives the packet with label 9001, it will
   forwarding to R3 by pushing header of 9003.  After R5 receives the
   packet with label 9002, it will forwarding to R5 by pushing header of
   9004.

   Step3: After R3 receives the packet with label 9003, it will
   forwarding to R8 by pushing header of 9005

   PCECC network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP, which includes both the RSVP-TE
   P2MP based LSP and also the mLDP based LSP.

   An end-to-end protection (for nodes and links) principle can be
   applied for computing backup P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  During computation
   of the primarily multicast trees, PCECC server may also be taken into
   consideration to compute a secondary tree.  A PCE may compute the
   primary and backup P2MP or MP2Mp LSP together or sequentially.

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast tree
   from the root node R1 to the leafs, which is R1->R2->{R4, R5}, at
   same time, it can setup the backup tree, which is R11->R3->{R4, R5}.
   Both the these two primary forwarding tree and secondary forwarding
   tree will be downloaded to each routers along the primary path and
   the secondary path.  The traffic will be forwarded through the
   R1->R2->{R4, R5} path normally, and when there is a node in the
   primary tree, then the root node R1 will switch the flow to the
   backup tree, which is R11->R3->{R4, R5}.  By using the PCECC, the
   path computation and forwarding path downloading can all be done
   without the complex signaling used in the P2MP RSVP-TE or mLDP.

   In this section we describe the local protection service in the PCECC
   network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   While the PCECC sets up the primary multicast tree, it can also build
   the back LSP among PLR, the protected node, and MPs (the downstream
   nodes of the protected node).  In the cases where the amount of

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast path
   around the PLR node R10 to protect node R20, which is R10->R20->{R40,
   R50}, at same time, it can setup the backup path R10->R30->{R40,
   R50}.  Both the these two primary forwarding path and secondary
   forwarding path will be downloaded to each routers along the primary
   path and the secondary path.  The traffic will be forwarded through
   the R10->R20->{R40, R50} path normally, and when there is a node
   failure for node R20, then the PLR node R10 will switch the flow to
   the backup path, which is R10->R30->{R40, R50}.  By using the PCECC,
   the path computation and forwarding path downloading can all be done
   without the complex signaling used in the P2MP RSVP-TE or mLDP.

3.4.3.  Using reliable P2MP TE based multicast delivery for distributed
        computations (MapReduce-Hadoop)

   MapReduce model of distributed computations in computing clusters is
   widely deployed.  In Hadoop 1.0 architecture MapReduce operations on
   big data performs by means of Master-Slave architecture in the Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS),where NameNode has the knowledge about
   resources of the cluster and where actual data (chunks) for
   particular task are located (which DataNode).  Each chunk of data
   (64MB or more) should have 3 saved copies in different DataNodes
   based on their proximity.

   Proximity level currently has semi-manual allocation and based on
   Rack IDs (Assumption is that closer data are better because of access
   speed/smaller latency).

   JobTracker node is responsible for computation tasks, scheduling
   across DataNodes and also have Rack-awareness.  Currently transport
   protocols between NameNode/JobTracker and DataNodes are based on IP
   unicast.  It has simplicity as pros but has numerous drawbacks
   related with its flat approach.

   It is clear that we should go beyond of one DC for Hadoop cluster
   creation and move towards distributed clusters.  In that case we need
   to handle performance and latency issues.  Latency depends on speed
   of light in fiber links and also latency introduced by intermediate
   devices in between.  The last one is closely correlated with network
   device architecture and performance.  Current performance of NPU
   based routers should be enough for creating distribute Hadoop
   clusters with predicted latency.  Performance of SW based routers
   (mainly as VNF) together with additional HW features such as DPDK are
   promising but require additional research and testing.

   Main question is how can we create simple but effective architecture
   for distributed Hadoop cluster?

   There are number of researches [Multicast Tree Map-Reduce...] which
   show how usage of multicast tree could improve speed of resource or
   cluster members discovery inside the cluster as well as increase
   redundancy in communications between cluster nodes.

   Is traditional IP based multicast enough for that?  We doubt it
   because it requires additional control plane (IGMP, PIM) and a lot of
   signaling, that is not suitable for high performance computations,
   that are very sensitive to latency.

   P2MP TE tunnels looks much more suitable as potential solution for
   creation of multicast based communications between Master and Slave

   nodes inside cluster.  Obviously these P2MP tunnels should be
   dynamically created and turned down (no manual intervention).  Here
   is there PCECC comes to play.  His main task is to create optimal
   topology of each partucular request for MapReduce computation and
   also create P2MP tunnels with needed parameters such as badnwidth and
   delay.

   This solution would require to use MPLS label based forwarding inside
   the cluster.  Usage of label based forwarding inside DC was proposed
   by Yandex [MPLS in DC...] Technically it is already possible because
   mpls on switches is already supported by some vendors, mpls aslo
   exists on Linux and OVS.

   The following framework can make this task:

   +----------+       +----------+      +----------+

   Communication between Master nodes (JobTracker and NameNode) and
   PCECC via REST API MAY be either done directly or via cluster manager
   such as Mesos.

   Phase 1: Distributed cluster resources discovery During this phase
   Master Nodes SHOULD identify and find available Slave nodes according

   to computing request from application (APP).  NameNode SHOULD query
   PCECC about available DataNodes, NameNode MAY provide additional
   constrains to PCECC such as topological proximity, redundancy level.

   PCECC SHOULD analyze the topology of distributed cluster and perform
   constrain based path calculation [RFC7334] from client towards most
   suitable NameNodes.  PCECC SHOULD reply to NameNode the list of most
   suitable DataNodes and their resource capabilities.  Topology
   discovery mechanism for PCECC will be added later to that framework.

   Phase 2: PCECC SHOULD create P2MP LSP from client towards those
   DataNodes by means of PCLabelUpd [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-
   pce-controller] PCEP messages following previously calculated path.

   Phase 3.  NameNode SHOULD send this information to client, PCECC
   informs client about optimal P2MP path towards DataNodes via PCEP
   PCUpd message.

   Phase 4.  Client sends data blocks to those DataNodes for writing via
   created P2MP tunnel.

   When this task will be finished, P2MP tunnel MAY be turned down.

3.5.  Use Cases of PCECC for LSP in the Network Migration

   One of the main advantages for PCECC solution is that it has backward
   compatibility naturally since the PCE server itself can function as a
   proxy node of MPLS network for all the new nodes which don't support
   the existing MPLS signaling protocol anymore.

   As it is illustrated in the following example, the current network
   will migrate to a total PCECC controlled network gradually by
   replacing the legacy nodes.  During the migration, the legacy nodes
   still need to signal using the existing MPLS protocol such as LDP and
   RSVP-TE, and the new nodes setup their portion of the forwarding path
   through PCECC directly.  With the PCECC function as the proxy of
   these new nodes, MPLS signaling can populate through network as
   normal.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

   Example: PCECC Initiated LSP Setup In the Network Migration

   In this example, there are five nodes for the TE LSP from head end
   (Node1) to the tail end (Node5).  Where the Node4 and Node5 are
   centrally controlled and other nodes are legacy nodes.

   o  Node1 sends a path request message for the setup of LSP
      destinating to Node5.

   o  PCECC sends to node1 a reply message for LSP setup with the path:
      (Node1, if1),(Node2, if2), (Node3, if3), (Node4, if4), Node5.

   o  Node1, Node2, Node3 will setup the LSP to Node5 using the local
      labels as usual.

   o  Then the PCECC will program the outsegment of Node3, the
      insegment/ ousegment of Node4, and the insegment for Node5.

3.6.  Use Cases of PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   The existing services using MPLS LSP tunnels based on MPLS signalling
   mechanism such L3VPN, PWE3 and IPv6 can be simplified by using the
   PCECC to negoitate the label assignments for the L3VPN, PWE3 and
   Ipv6.

   In the case of L3VPN, VPN labels can be negotiated and distributed
   through the PCECC PCEP among the PE router instead of using the BGP
   protocols.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

   Example: Using PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   In the cast PWE3, instead of using the LDP signalling protocols, the
   lable and port pairs assigned to each pseudowire can be negotiated
   through PCECC among the PE rotuers and the corresponding forwarding
   entries will be distributed into each PE routers through the extended
   PCEP protocols.

3.7.  Using PCECC for Traffic Classification Information

   When a TE-LSP is set up, the head end needs to know:

   o  how to use it

   o  What traffic to send on the LSP

   o  Whether it is a virtual link

   o  Whether to advertise it in the IGP

   o  What bits of this information to signal to the tail end

   PCEP allows an Active PCE to set up or modify LSPs.  But we have no
   way to tell the head end how to use the LSP.  This is because of
   history.  It used to be the LER that made the request of the PCE, so
   it knew why it wanted the LSP.

   With the PCECC architecture by extending the PCEP protocols, it is
   easy to carry this information such as how to use the LSP, how to
   advertise the LSP and other extra signaling information.
