The Use Cases for Path Computation Element (PCE) as a Central Controller
                                (PCECC).

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.  PCE was developed to
   derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied
   to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP).

   SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function
   Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network.  It
   is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for
   use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a
   central controller.

   This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment
   and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its
   challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCEP
   extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate
   documents.

1.  Introduction

   An Architecture for Use of PCE and PCEP in a Network with Central
   Control [RFC8283] describes SDN architecture where the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) determines paths for variety of diferent
   usecases, with PCEP as a general southbound communication protocol
   with all the nodes along the path..

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] introduces the
   procedures and extensions for PCEP to support the PCECC architecture
   [RFC8283].

   This draft describes the various usecases for the PCECC architecture.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2018


   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCECC:  PCE as a central controller.  Extension of PCE to support SDN
      functions as per [RFC8283].

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

3.  Application Scenarios

   In the following sections, several use cases are described,
   showcasing scenarios that benefit from the deployment of PCECC.

3.1.  Use Cases of PCECC for Label Management

   As per [RFC8283], in some cases, the PCE-based controller can take
   responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS label space for
   each of the routers that it controls, and it may taker wider
   responsibility for partitioning the label space for each router and
   allocating different parts for different uses, communicating the
   ranges to the router using PCEP.

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] describe a mode
   where LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop
   on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told what
   label forwarding instructions to program and what resources to
   reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP.  For this to work, the PCE-
   based controller will take responsibility for managing some part of
   the MPLS label space for each of the routers that it controls.  An
   extention to PCEP could be done to allow a PCC to inform the PCE of
   such a label space to control.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to PCEP that
   allow a stateful PCE to compute, update or initiate SR-TE paths.
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] describes the
   mechanism for PCECC to allocate and provision the node/prefix/
   adjacency label (SID) via PCEP.  To make such allocation PCE needs to
   be aware of the label space from Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB)
   or Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB) [RFC8402] of the node that it
   controls.  A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of such a label
   space to control is needed within PCEP.  The full SRGB/SRLB of a node
   could be learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism too.

   [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space] defines a PCEP extention to support
   advertisement of the MPLS label space to the PCE to control.

   There have been various proposals for Global Labels, the PCECC
   architecture could be used as means to learn the label space of
   nodes, and could also be used to determine and provision the global
   label range.

   o  PCC would advertise the PCECC capability to the PCE (central
      controller-PCECC)
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   o  The PCECC could also learn the label range set aside by the PCC
      ([I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space]).

   o  Optionally, the PCECC could determine the shared MPLS global label
      range for the network.

      o  In the case that the shared global label range need to be
         negotiated across multiple domains, the central controllers of
         these domains would also need to negotiate a common global
         label range across domains.

      o  The PCECC would need to set the shared global label range to
         all PCC nodes in the network.

3.2.  Using PCECC for SR

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Using
   SR, a source node steers a packet through a path without relying on
   hop-by-hop signaling protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is
   specified as an ordered list of instructions called "segments".  Each
   segment is an instruction to route the packet to a specific place in
   the network, or to perform a specific service on the packet.  A
   database of segments can be distributed through the network using a
   routing protocol (such as IS-IS or OSPF) or by any other means.  PCEP
   (and PCECC) could be one such means.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specify the SR specific PCEP
   extensions.  PCECC may further use PCEP protocol for SR SID (Segment
   Identifier) distribution to the SR nodes (PCC) with some benefits.
   If the PCECC allocates and maintains the SID in the network for the
   nodes and adjacencies; and further distributes them to the SR nodes
   directly via the PCEP session has some advantage over the
   configurations on each SR node and flooding via IGP, especially in a
   SDN environment.

   When the PCECC is used for the distribution of the node segment ID
   and adjacency segment ID, the node segment ID is allocated from the
   SRGB of the node.  For the allocation of adjacency segment ID, the
   allocation is from the SRLB of the node as described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   [RFC8355] identifies various protection and resiliency usecases for
   SR.  Path protection lets the ingress node be in charge of the
   failure recovery (used for SR-TE).  Also protection can be performed
   by the node adjacent to the failed component, commonly referred to as
   local protection techniques or fast-reroute (FRR) techniques.  In
   case of PCECC, the protection paths can be pre-computated and setup
   by the PCE.

   The following example illustrate the use case where the node SID and
   adjacency SID are allocated by the PCECC.

3.2.1.  PCECC SID Allocation

   Each node (PCC) is allocated a node-SID by the PCECC.  The PCECC
   needs to update the label map of each node to all the nodes in the
   domain.  On receiving the label map, each node (PCC) uses the local
   routing information to determine the next-hop and download the label
   forwarding instructions accordingly.  The forwarding behavior and the
   end result is same as IGP based Node-SID in SR.  Thus, from anywhere
   in the domain, it enforces the ECMP-aware shortest-path forwarding of
   the packet towards the related node.

   For each adjacency in the network, PCECC can allocate an Adj-SID.
   The PCECC sends PCInitiate message to update the label map of each
   Adj to the corresponding nodes in the domain.  Each node (PCC)
   download the label forwarding instructions accordingly.  The
   forwarding behavior and the end result is similar to IGP based "Adj-
   SID" in SR.

   The various mechanism are described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

3.2.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Best Effort (BE) Path

   In this mode of the solution, the PCECC just need to allocate the
   node segment ID and adjacency ID (without calculating the explicit
   path for the SR path).  The ingress of the forwarding path just need
   to encapsulate the destination node segment ID on top of the packet.
   All the intermediate nodes will forward the packet based on the
   destination node SID.  It is similar to the LDP LSP.

   R1 may send a packet to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008} (Node SID for R8).  The path would be the based
   on the routing/nexthop calculation on the routers.

3.2.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Traffic Engineering (TE) Path

   SR-TE paths may not follow an IGP SPT.  Such paths may be chosen by a
   PCECC and provisioned on the ingress node of the SR-TE path.  The SR
   header consists of a list of SIDs (or MPLS labels).  The header has
   all necessary information so that, the packets can be guided from the
   ingress node to the egress node of the path; hence, there is no need
   for any signaling protocol.  For the case where strict traffic
   engineering path is needed, all the adjacency SID are stacked,
   otherwise a combination of node-SID or adj-SID can be used for the
   SR-TE paths.

   Note that the bandwidth reservations is only guaranteed through the
   enforce of the bandwidth admission control.  As for the RSVP-TE LSP
   case, the control plane signaling also does the link bandwidth
   reservation in each hop of the path.

   The SR traffic engineering path examples are explained as bellow:

   Note that the node SID for each node is allocated from the SRGB and
   adjacency SID for each link are allocated from the SRLB for each
   node.

   Example 1:

   R1 may send a packet P1 to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008}.  Based on the best path, it could be:
   R1-R2-R3-R8.

   Example 2:

   R1 may send a packet P2 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
   list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-(1)link-R3-R8.

   Example 3:

   R1 may send a packet P3 to R8 via R4 by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1004, 1008}.  The path could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8

   The local protection examples for SR TE path are explained as below:

   Example 4: local link protection:

   o  R1 may send a packet P4 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-(1)link-R3-R8.

   o  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      R2-(1)link-R3-R8, and also find out there is a link failure of
      link1, then the R2 can enforce the traffic over the bypass to send
      out the packet with header of R3-R8 through link2.

   Example 5: local node protection:

   o  R1 may send a packet P5 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1004, 1008}.  The path should be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8.

   o  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      {1004, 1008}, and also find out there is a node failure for node4,
      then it can enforce the traffic over the bypass and send out the
      packet with header of {1005, 1008} to node5 instead of node4.

3.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for TE LSP

   In the previous sections, we have discussed the cases where the SR
   path is setup through the PCECC.  Although those cases give the
   simplicity and scalability, but there are existing functionalities
   for the traffic engineering path such as the bandwidth guarantee,
   monitoring where SR based solution are complex.  Also there are cases
   where the depth of the label stack is an issue for existing
   deployment and certain vendors.

   So to address these issues, PCECC architecture also support the TE
   LSP functionalities.  To achieve this, the existing PCEP can be used
   to communicate between the PCECC and nodes along the path.  This is
   similar to static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as explicit
   label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router
   along the path must be told what label- forwarding instructions to
   program and what resources to reserve.  The PCE-based controller
   keeps a view of the network and determines the paths of the end-to-
   end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to communicate with each
   router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

                   Figure 2: PCECC TE LSP Setup Example

   o  Based on path computation request / delegation or PCE initiation,
      the PCECC receives the PCECC request with constraints and
      optimization criteria.

   o  PCECC would calculate the optimal path according to given
      constrains (i.e.bandwidth).

   o  PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
      and outgoing labels from R1 to R8 with the path: {R1, link1,
      1001}, {1001, R2, link3, 2003], {2003, R4, link10, 4010}, {4010,
      R3, link8, 3008}, {3008, R8}.

   o  For the end to end protection, PCECC program each node along the
      path from R1 to R8 with the secondary path: {R1, link2, 1002},

      {1002, R2, link4, 2004], {2004, R5, link7, 5007}, {5007, R3,
      link9, 3009}, {3009, R8}.

   o  It is also possible to have a bypass path for the local protection
      setup by the PCECC.  For example, the primary path as above, then
      to protect the node R4 locally, PCECC can program the bypass path
      like this: {R2, link5, 2005], {2005, R3}. By doing this, the node
      R4 is locally protected at R2.

3.3.1.  PCECC Load Balancing (LB) Use Case

   Very often many service providers use TE tunnels for solving issues
   with non-deterministic paths in their networks.  One example of such
   applications is usage of TEs in the mobile backhaul (MBH).  Let's
   consider the following typical topology.

                              TE1 -------------->
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
| Access  |----| Access |----| AGG 1  |----| AGG N-1|----|Core 1|--|SR1|
| SubNode1|    | Node 1 |    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
+---------+    +--------+         | |           | ^          |
     |   Access    |    Access    | AGG Ring 1  | |          |
     |  SubRing 1  |    Ring 1    | |           | |          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+         | |          |
| Access  |    | Access |    | AGG 2  |         | |          |
| SubNode2|    | Node 2 |    +--------+         | |          |
+---------+    +--------+         | |           | |          |
     |             |              | |           | |          |
     |             |              | +----TE2----|-+          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
| Access  |    | Access |----| AGG 3  |----| AGG N  |----|Core N|--|SRn|
| SubNodeN|----| Node N |    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
+---------+    +--------+

   This MBH architecture uses L2 access rings and subrings.  L3 starts
   at aggregation.  For the sake of simplicity here we have only one
   access subring, access ring and aggregation ring (AGG1...AGGN),
   connected by Nx10GE interfaces.  Aggregation domain runs its own IGP.
   There are two Egress routers (AGG N-1,AGG N) that are connected to
   the Core domain via L2 interfaces.  Core also have connections to
   service routers, RSVP TEs are used for MPLS transport inside the
   ring.  There could be at least 2 tunnels (one way) from each AGG
   router to egress AGG routers.  There are also many L2 access rings
   connected to AGG routers.

   Service deployment made by means of either L2VPNs (VPLS) or L3VPNs.
   Those services use MPLS TE as transport towards egress AGG routers.

   TE tunnels could be also used as transport towards service routers in
   case of seamless MPLS based architecture in the future.

   There is a need to solve the following tasks:

   o  Perform automatic LB amongst TE tunnels according to current
      traffic load.

   o  TE bandwidth (BW) management: Provide guaranteed BW for specific
      service: HSI, IPTV, etc., provide time-based BW reservation (BoD)
      for other services.

   o  Simplify development of TE tunnels by automation without any
      manual intervention.

   o  Provide flexibility for Service Router placement (anywhere in the
      network by creation of transport LSPs to them).

   Since other tasks are considered in other PCECC use cases above,
   hereafter we will focus only on load balancing (LB) task.  LB task
   could be solved by means of PCECC in the following way:

   o  After application or network service or operator can ask SDN
      controller (PCECC) for LSP based LB between AGG X and AGG N/AGG
      N-1 (egress AGG routers which have connections to core) via North
      Bound Interface (NBI).  Each of these would have associated
      constrains (i.e.  LSP type: traditional CR-LSP or SR-TE LSP,
      bandwidth, inclusion or exclusion specific links or nodes, number
      of paths, shortest path or minimum cost tree, need for disjoint
      LSP paths etc.).

   o  PCECC could calculate multiple (Say N) LSPs according to given
      constrains, calculation is based on results of Objective Function
      (OF), constraints, endpoints, same or different bandwidth (BW) ,
      different links (in case of disjoint paths) and other constrains.

   o  Depending on given LSP Path setup type (PST), PCECC would use
      download instructions to the PCC.  At this stage it is assumed the
      PCECC is aware of the label space it controls and in case of SR
      the SID allocation and distribution is already done.

   o  PCECC would send PCInitiate PCEP message [RFC8281] towards ingress
      AGG X router(PCC) for each of N LSPs and receives PCRpt PCEP
      message [RFC8231] back from PCCs.  If the PST is PCECC-SR, the
      PCECC would include the SID stack as per
      [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].  If the PST is PCECC (basic), then
      the PCECC would assigns labels along the calculated path; and set
      up the path by sending central controller instructions in PCEP

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2018


      message to each node along the path of the LSP as per
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and then send
      PCUpd message to the ingress AGG X router with information about
      new LSP and AGG X(PCC) would respond with PCRpt with LSP status.

   o  AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG N-1
      which are available for installing to router's forwarding and LB
      of traffic between them.  Traffic distribution between those LSPs
      depends on particular realization of hash-function on that router.

   o  Since PCECC knows as LSDB as TEDB (TE state) he can manage and
      prevent possible oversubscriptions and limit number of available
      LB states.  Via PCECC mechanism the control can take quick actions
      into the network by directly provisioning the central control
      instructions.

3.3.2.  PCECC and Inter-AS TE

   There are various signaling options for establishing Inter-AS TE LSP:
   contiguous TE LSP [RFC5151], stitched TE LSP [RFC5150], nested TE LSP
   [RFC4206].

   Requirements for PCE-based Inter-AS setup [RFC5376] describe the
   approach and PCEP functionality that are needed for establishing
   Inter-AS TE LSPs.

   [RFC5376] also gives Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model that is
   provided below in shorten form for the sake of simplicity.

              Inter-AS       Inter-AS
        PCC <-->PCE1<--------->PCE2

         |   AS1 |        |    PCC     |
         |       |        |    AS2     |
         R2----ASBR2====ASBR4---R4---ASBR6
         ::                     ::
         ::                     ::
      Intra-AS               Intra-AS
         PCE3                   PCE4

    Shorten form of Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model [RFC5376]

   The PCECC belonging to different domain can co-operate to setup
   inter-AS TE LSP.  The stateful H-PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce]
   mechanism could be used to first establish a per-domain PCECC LSP.

   These could be stitched together to form inter-AS TE LSP as described
   in [I-D.dugeon-pce-stateful-interdomain].

   Hereatfter we will focus on a simplified Inter-AS case when both AS1
   and AS2 belong to the same service provider administration.  In that
   case Inter and Intra-AS PCEs could be combined in one single PCE if
   such combined PCE performance is enough for handling all Path
   Computation Requests.  Even more in that particular case we
   potentially could use single PCE for both ASes if the scalability and
   performance are enough, we require interfaces (PCEP and BGP-LS) to
   both domains.  PCECC redundancy mechanisms are described in
   [RFC8283].  Thus routers in AS1 and AS2 (PCCs) can send Path
   Computation messages towards same PCECC.

                  Particular case of Inter-AS PCE

   In a case of PCECC Inter-AS TE scenario where service provider
   controls both domains (AS1 and AS2), each of them have own IGP and
   MPLS transport.  There is a need is to setup Inter-AS LSPs for
   transporting different services on top of them (Voice, L3VPN etc.).
   Inter-AS links with different capacity exist in several regions.  The
   task is not only to provision those Inter-AS LSPs with given
   constrains but also calculate the path and pre-setup the backup
   Inter-AS LSPs that will be used if primary LSP fails.

   For the figure above it would be that LSP1 from R1 to R3 may go via
   ASBR1 and ASBR3, and it is the primary Inter-AS LSP.  R1-R3 LSP2 that
   go via ASBR5 and ASBR6 is the backup one.  In adition there could be
   bypass LSP setup to protect against ASBR or inter-AS link failure.

   After the addition of PCECC functionality to PCE (SDN controller),
   PCECC based Inter-AS TE model SHOULD follow as PCECC usecase for TE
   LSP as requirements of [RFC5376] with the following details:

   o  Since PCECC needs to know the topology of both domains AS1 and
      AS2, PCECC could use BGP-LS peering with routers (or RRs) in both
      domains.

   o  PCECC needs to PCEP connectivity towards all routers in both
      domains (see also section 4 in [RFC5376]) in a similar manner as a
      SDN controller.

   o  After operator's application or service orchestrator will create
      request for tunnel creation of specific service, PCECC SHOULD
      receive that request via NBI (NBI type is implementation
      dependent, MAY be NETCONF/Yang, REST etc.).  Then PCECC would
      calculate the optimal path based on Objective Function (OF) and
      given constrains (i.e. path setup type, bandwidth etc.), including
      those from [RFC5376]: priority, AS sequence, preferred ASBR,
      disjoint paths, protection.  On this step we would have two paths:
      R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3

   o  Depending on given LSP PST (PCECC or PCECC-SR), PCECC would use
      download instructions to the PCC.  At this stage it is assumed the
      PCECC is aware of the label space it controls and in case of SR
      the SID allocation and distribution is already done.

   o  PCECC would send PCInitiate PCEP message [RFC8281] towards ingress
      router R1 (PCC) in AS1 and receives PCRpt PCEP message [RFC8231]
      back from PCC.  If the PST is PCECC-SR, the PCECC would include
      the SID stack as per [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].  It may also
      include binding SID based on AS boundary.  The backup SID stack
      could also be installed at ingress but more importantly each node
      along the SR path could also do local protection just based on the
      top segement.  If the PST is PCECC (basic), then the PCECC would
      assigns labels along the calculated paths (R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3,
      R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3); and set up the path by sending central
      controller instructions in PCEP message to each node along the
      path of the LSPs as per
      [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and then send
      PCUpd message to the ingress R1 router with information about new
      LSPs and R1 would respond with PCRpt with LSP(s) status.

   o  AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG N-1
      which are available for installing to router's forwarding and LB
      of traffic between them.  Traffic distribution between those LSPs
      depends on particular realization of hash-function on that router.

   o  After that step R1 now have primary and backup TEs (LSP1 and LSP2)
      towards R3.  It is up to router implementation how to make
      switchover to backup LSP2 if LSP1 fails.

3.4.  Use Cases of PCECC for Multicast LSPs

   The current multicast LSPs are setup either using the RSVP-TE P2MP or
   mLDP protocols.  The setup of these LSPs may require manual
   configurations and complex signaling when the protection is
   considered.  By using the PCECC solution, the multicast LSP can be
   computed and setup through centralized controller which has the full
   picture of the topology and bandwidth usage for each link.  It not
   only reduces the complex configurations comparing the distributed
   RSVP-TE P2MP or mLDP signaling, but also it can compute the disjoint
   primary path and secondary P2MP path efficiently.

3.4.1.  Using PCECC for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs' Setup

   It is assumed the PCECC is aware of the label space it controls for
   all nodes and make allocations accordingly.

   o  Based on the P2MP path computation request / delegation or PCE
      initiation, the PCECC receives the PCECC request with constraints
      and optimization criteria.

   o  PCECC would calculate the optimal P2MP path according to given
      constrains (i.e.bandwidth).

   o  PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
      and outgoing labels from R1 to {R6, R8} with the path: {R1, 6000},
      {6000, R2, {9001,9002}}, {9001, R4, 9003}, {9002, R5, 9004} {9003,
      R3, 9005}, {9004, R6}, {9005, R8}. The main difference is in the
      branch node instruction at R2 where two copies of packet are sent
      towards R4 and R5 with 9001 and 9002 labels respectively.

   The packet forwarding involves -

      Step1: R1 may send a packet P1 to R2 simply by pushing an label of
      6000 to the packet.

      Step2: After R2 receives the packet with label 6000, it will
      forwarding to R4 by swapping label to 9001 and by swapping label
      of 9002 towards R5.

      Step3: After R4 receives the packet with label 9001, it will
      forwarding to R3 by swapping to 9003.  After R5 receives the
      packet with label 9002, it will forwarding to R6 by swapping to
      9004.

      Step4: After R3 receives the packet with label 9003, it will
      forwarding to R8 by swapping to 9005 and when R5 receives the
      packet with label 9004, it will swap to 9004 and send to R6.

      Step5: Packet received at R8 and 9005 is popped; packet receives
      at R6 and 9004 is popped.

3.4.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for the Resiliency of P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

3.4.2.1.  PCECC for the End-to-End Protection of the P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

   In this section we describe the end-to-end managed path protection
   service as well as the local protection with the operation management
   in the PCECC network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   An end-to-end protection principle can be applied for computing
   backup P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  During computation of the primary
   multicast trees, PCECC server may also take the computation of a
   secondary tree into consideration.  A PCE may compute the primary and
   backup P2MP (or MP2MP) LSP together or sequentially.

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast tree
   from the root node R1 to the leaves, which is R1->R2->{R4, R5}, at
   same time, it can setup the backup tree, which is R1->R11->R3->{R4,
   R5}.  Both the these two primary forwarding tree and secondary
   forwarding tree will be downloaded to each routers along the primary
   path and the secondary path.  The traffic will be forwarded through
   the R1->R2->{R4, R5} path normally, and when there is a node in the
   primary tree fails (say R2), then the root node R1 will switch the
   flow to the backup tree, which is R1->R11->R3->{R4, R5}.  By using
   the PCECC, the path computation and forwarding path downloading can
   all be done without the complex signaling used in the P2MP RSVP-TE or
   mLDP.

3.4.2.2.  PCECC for the Local Protection of the P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

   In this section we describe the local protection service in the PCECC
   network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   While the PCECC sets up the primary multicast tree, it can also build
   the back LSP among PLR, the protected node, and MPs (the downstream
   nodes of the protected node).  In the cases where the amount of
   downstream nodes are huge, this mechanism can avoid unnecessary
   packet duplication on PLR and protect the network from traffic
   congestion risk.

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast path
   around the PLR node R10 to protect node R20, which is R10->R20->{R40,
   R50}, at same time, it can setup the backup path R10->R30->{R40,
   R50}.  Both the these two primary forwarding path and secondary
   bypass forwarding path will be downloaded to each routers along the
   primary path and the secondary bypass path.  The traffic will be
   forwarded through the R10->R20->{R40, R50} path normally, and when
   there is a node failure for node R20, then the PLR node R10 will
   switch the flow to the backup path, which is R10->R30->{R40, R50}.
   By using the PCECC, the path computation and forwarding path
   downloading can all be done without the complex signaling used in the
   P2MP RSVP-TE or mLDP.

3.5.  Use Cases of PCECC for LSP in the Network Migration

   One of the main advantages for PCECC solution is that it has backward
   compatibility naturally since the PCE server itself can function as a
   proxy node of MPLS network for all the new nodes which don't support
   the existing MPLS signaling protocol anymore.

   As it is illustrated in the following example, the current network
   will migrate to a total PCECC controlled network gradually by
   replacing the legacy nodes.  During the migration, the legacy nodes
   still need to signal using the existing MPLS protocol such as LDP and
   RSVP-TE, and the new nodes setup their portion of the forwarding path
   through PCECC directly.  With the PCECC function as the proxy of
   these new nodes, MPLS signaling can populate through network as
   normal.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

   Example: PCECC Initiated LSP Setup In the Network Migration

   In this example, there are five nodes for the TE LSP from head end
   (Node1) to the tail end (Node5).  Where the Node4 and Node5 are
   centrally controlled and other nodes are legacy nodes.

   o  Node1 sends a path request message for the setup of LSP
      destinating to Node5.

   o  PCECC sends to node1 a reply message for LSP setup with the path:
      (Node1, if1),(Node2, if2), (Node3, if3), (Node4, if4), Node5.

   o  Node1, Node2, Node3 will setup the LSP to Node5 using the local
      labels as usual.

   o  Then the PCECC will program the outsegment of Node3, the
      insegment/ ousegment of Node4, and the insegment for Node5.

3.6.  Use Cases of PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   The existing services using MPLS LSP tunnels based on MPLS signalling
   mechanism such L3VPN, PWE3 and IPv6 can be simplified by using the
   PCECC to negoitate the label assignments for the L3VPN, PWE3 and
   Ipv6.

   In the case of L3VPN, VPN labels can be negotiated and distributed
   through the PCECC PCEP among the PE router instead of using the BGP
   protocols.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

               +-------------------------------------------+

   Example: Using PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   In the cast PWE3, instead of using the LDP signalling protocols, the
   lable and port pairs assigned to each pseudowire can be negotiated
   through PCECC among the PE rotuers and the corresponding forwarding
   entries will be distributed into each PE routers through the extended
   PCEP protocols.

3.7.  Using PCECC for Traffic Classification Information

   When a TE-LSP is set up, the head end needs to know:

   o  how to use it

   o  What traffic to send on the LSP

   o  Whether it is a virtual link

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2018


   o  Whether to advertise it in the IGP

   o  What bits of this information to signal to the tail end

   PCEP allows an Active PCE to set up or modify LSPs.  But we have no
   way to tell the head end how to use the LSP.  This is because of
   history.  It used to be the LER that made the request of the PCE, so
   it knew why it wanted the LSP.

   With the PCECC architecture by extending the PCEP protocols, it is
   easy to carry this information such as how to use the LSP, how to
   advertise the LSP and other extra signaling information.

Appendix A.  Using reliable P2MP TE based multicast delivery for
             distributed computations (MapReduce-Hadoop)

   MapReduce model of distributed computations in computing clusters is
   widely deployed.  In Hadoop 1.0 architecture MapReduce operations on
   big data performs by means of Master-Slave architecture in the Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS),where NameNode has the knowledge about
   resources of the cluster and where actual data (chunks) for
   particular task are located (which DataNode).  Each chunk of data
   (64MB or more) should have 3 saved copies in different DataNodes
   based on their proximity.

   Proximity level currently has semi-manual allocation and based on
   Rack IDs (Assumption is that closer data are better because of access
   speed/smaller latency).

   JobTracker node is responsible for computation tasks, scheduling
   across DataNodes and also have Rack-awareness.  Currently transport
   protocols between NameNode/JobTracker and DataNodes are based on IP
   unicast.  It has simplicity as pros but has numerous drawbacks
   related with its flat approach.

   It is clear that we should go beyond of one DC for Hadoop cluster
   creation and move towards distributed clusters.  In that case we need
   to handle performance and latency issues.  Latency depends on speed

   of light in fiber links and also latency introduced by intermediate
   devices in between.  The last one is closely correlated with network
   device architecture and performance.  Current performance of NPU
   based routers should be enough for creating distribute Hadoop
   clusters with predicted latency.  Performance of SW based routers
   (mainly as VNF) together with additional HW features such as DPDK are
   promising but require additional research and testing.

   Main question is how can we create simple but effective architecture
   for distributed Hadoop cluster?

   There is research [MAP-REDUCE] which show how usage of multicast tree
   could improve speed of resource or cluster members discovery inside
   the cluster as well as increase redundancy in communications between
   cluster nodes.

   Is traditional IP based multicast enough for that?  We doubt it
   because it requires additional control plane (IGMP, PIM) and a lot of
   signaling, that is not suitable for high performance computations,
   that are very sensitive to latency.

   P2MP TE tunnels looks much more suitable as potential solution for
   creation of multicast based communications between Master and Slave
   nodes inside cluster.  Obviously these P2MP tunnels should be
   dynamically created and turned down (no manual intervention).  Here
   is there PCECC comes to play.  His main task is to create optimal
   topology of each particular request for MapReduce computation and
   also create P2MP tunnels with needed parameters such as bandwidth and
   delay.

   This solution would require to use MPLS label based forwarding inside
   the cluster.  Usage of label based forwarding inside DC was proposed
   by Yandex [MPLS-DC].  Technically it is already possible because MPLS
   on switches is already supported by some vendors, MPLS also exists on
   Linux and OVS.

   The following framework can make this task:

   Communication between Master nodes (JobTracker and NameNode) and
   PCECC via REST API MAY be either done directly or via cluster manager
   such as Mesos.

   Phase 1: Distributed cluster resources discovery During this phase
   Master Nodes SHOULD identify and find available Slave nodes according
   to computing request from application (APP).  NameNode SHOULD query
   PCECC about available DataNodes, NameNode MAY provide additional
   constrains to PCECC such as topological proximity, redundancy level.

   PCECC SHOULD analyze the topology of distributed cluster and perform
   constrain based path calculation [RFC7334] from client towards most
   suitable NameNodes.  PCECC SHOULD reply to NameNode the list of most
   suitable DataNodes and their resource capabilities.  Topology
   discovery mechanism for PCECC will be added later to that framework.

   Phase 2: PCECC SHOULD create P2MP LSP from client towards those
   DataNodes by means of PCLabelUpd [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-
   pce-controller] PCEP messages following previously calculated path.

   Phase 3.  NameNode SHOULD send this information to client, PCECC
   informs client about optimal P2MP path towards DataNodes via PCEP
   PCUpd message.

   Phase 4.  Client sends data blocks to those DataNodes for writing via
   created P2MP tunnel.

   When this task will be finished, P2MP tunnel MAY be turned down.
