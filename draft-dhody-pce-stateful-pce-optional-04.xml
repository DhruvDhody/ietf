<t>
   This document introduces a mechanism to mark some Path Computation
   Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) objects as optional during PCEP messages exchange for the Stateful PCE model to allow relaxing some constraints.</t> 
   </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
   <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
   communication Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between
   a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE),
   or between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture
   <xref target="RFC4655"/>. </t>

   <t>PCEP Extensions 
   for Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/> 
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels. 
   <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup and teardown of
   PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the
   need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> defined P flag (Processing-Rule) as part of Common Object Header
   to allow a PCC to specify
      in a Path Computation Request (PCReq) message sent to a PCE whether the object must be taken
      into account by the PCE during path computation or is just
      optional. The I flag (Ignore) is used by a PCE in a Path Computation Reply (PCRep)
      message to indicate to a PCC whether or not an optional object was
      processed. Stateful PCE <xref target="RFC8231"/> 
      specified that  P and I flags of the PCEP
   objects defined in <xref target="RFC8231"/> is to be set to zero on
   transmission and ignored on receipt since they are
   exclusively related to path computation requests. The behavior for P and I flag in 
   other messages defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/> and other extension was not specified. 
   This document clarifies how the P and I flag could be used in the stateful PCE model to identify 
   optional objects in the Path Computation State Report (PCRpt) <xref target="RFC8231"/>, the Path Computation Update Request (PCUpd) <xref target="RFC8231"/>, 
   and the LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) <xref target="RFC8281"/> message.</t>

   <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC8231"/> with respect to usage of P and I flag as well as 
   the handling of unknown objects in the stateful PCEP message exchange.</t>

    <section title="Overview" toc="default">
    <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the handling on unknown objects as per the setting of the P flag for the PCReq message. 
    Further <xref target="RFC8231"/> defined the usage of LSP Error Code TLV in PCRpt message in response to failed LSP Update Request
    via PCUpd message (for example, due to an unsupported object/TLV).</t>
    <t>This document clarifies the procedure for marking some objects as 'optional to be processed' by the PCEP peer in the stateful PCEP messages. Further
      this document updates the procedure for handling unknown objects in the stateful PCEP messages based on the P flag.</t>  
    <section title="Usage Example" toc="default">
    <t>The PCRpt message is used to report the current state of an LSP. As part of the message both the &lt;intended-attribute-list&gt; and &lt;actual-attribute-list&gt; is encoded (see <xref target="RFC8231"/>). 
      For example, the &lt;intended-attribute-list&gt; could include the METRIC object to indicate a limiting constraint (B flag set) for the Path Delay Variation metric <xref target="RFC8233"/>. In some scenarios it would be useful to state that this limiting constraint can be relaxed by the PCE in case it cannot find a path. Similarly in case of an association groups <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-association-group'/> such as Disjoint Association <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-diversity"/>, the PCE may need to completely relax the  
        disjointness constraint in order to provide a path to all the LSPs that are part of the association. In these case it would be useful to mark the objects as 'optional' and it could be ignored by the PCEP peer. Also it would be used for the PCEP speaker to learn if the PCEP peer has relaxed the constraint and ignored the processing of the PCEP object.</t>  

     <t>Thus, this document simply clarifies, how the already existing P and I flag in the PCEP common object header could be used during the stateful PCEP message exchanges.</t>   
    </section>
    </section>
    
<section title="PCEP Extension" toc="default">
  <section title="STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV" toc="default">
  <t>A PCEP speaker indicates its ability to support for handling P and I flag during the stateful PCEP message exchanges during the PCEP initialization phase, as follows. 
    When the PCEP session is created, it sends an Open message with an OPEN object that
   contains the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV, as defined in <xref target="RFC8231"/>.  A
   new flag, the R (RELAX) flag, is introduced to
   this TLV to indicate support for relaxing the processing of some objects via the use of P and I flag in the PCEP common object header.</t>
   <t>R (RELAX bit - TBD1): If set to 1 by a PCEP Speaker, the R flag indicates that the PCEP Speaker is willing to send and receive PCEP objects with handling of P and I flags in the PCEP common object header for stateful PCE messages. In case the bit is unset, it indicates that the PCEP Speaker would not handle P and I flags in the PCEP common object header for stateful PCE messages.</t>
   <t>The R flag MUST be set by both a PCC and a PCE to indicate support for handling of P and I flag in the PCEP common object header to allow relaxing some constraints by marking objects as optional to process. If the PCEP speaker that did not set R flag but receives PCEP objects with P or I bit set, MUST behave as per the processing rule in <xref target="RFC8231"/> i.e., the bits are simply ignored.</t>

</section>
  <section title="Handling of P flag" toc="default">
    <section title="The PCRpt message" toc="default">
      <t>The P flag in the PCRpt message <xref target="RFC8231"/> allows a PCC to specify
      to a PCE whether the object must be taken
      into account by the PCE (during path computation or re-optimization) or is just
      optional.  When the P flag is set in PCRpt message received on a PCEP session on which R bit was set by both peers, the object MUST be taken into
      account by the PCE.  Conversely, when the P flag is cleared, the
      object is optional and the PCE is free to ignore it. The P flag for the
      mandatory objects LSP and ERO (intended path) MUST be set in the 
      PCRpt message. If the mandatory object is
   received with the P flag set incorrectly according to the rules
   stated above, the receiving peer MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type=10 (Reception of an invalid object) and Error-value=1 
   (reception of an object with P flag not set). By default, the PCC 
   SHOULD set the P flag, unless a local configuration or local policy 
   indicates that some constraints (corresponding PCEP objects) can be
   marked as optional and could be ignored by the PCE.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="The PCUpd message and the PCInitiate message" toc="default">
      <t>The P flag in the PCUpd message <xref target="RFC8231"/> and the PCInitiate message <xref target="RFC8281"/> allows a PCE to specify
      to a PCC whether the object must be taken
      into account by the PCC (during path setup) or is just
      optional.  When the P flag is set in PCUpd/PCInitiate message received on a PCEP session on which R bit was set by both peers, the object MUST be taken into
      account by the PCC.  Conversely, when the P flag is cleared, the
      object is optional and the PCC is free to ignore it. The P flag for the
      mandatory objects SRP, LSP and ERO MUST be set in the 
      PCUpd/PCInitiate message. If the mandatory object is
   received with the P flag set incorrectly according to the rules
   stated above, the receiving peer MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type=10 (Reception of an invalid object) and Error-value=1 
   (reception of an object with P flag not set). By default, the PCE 
   SHOULD set the P flag, unless a local configuration or local policy 
   indicates that some constraints (corresponding PCEP objects) can be
   marked as optional and could be ignored by the PCC.</t>

  <section title="Handling of I flag" toc="default">
  <section title="The PCUpd message" toc="default">
       <t>The I flag in the PCUpd message <xref target="RFC8231"/> allows a PCE to 
       indicate to a PCC whether or not an optional object was
      processed.  The PCE MAY include the ignored optional object in its
      update request and set the I flag to indicate that the optional object was
      ignored.  When the I flag is cleared, the
      PCE indicates that the optional object was processed. </t>
  </section>    
  <section title="The PCRpt message" toc="default">
   <t>The I flag in the PCRpt message <xref target="RFC8231"/> allows a PCC to 
      indicate to a PCE whether or not an optional object was
      processed in response to an LSP Update Request (PCUpd) or LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate).  The PCC MAY include the ignored optional object in its
      report and set the I flag to indicate that the optional object was
      ignored at PCC.  When the I flag is cleared, the
      PCC indicates that the optional object was processed. 
      The I flag has no meaning if the PCRpt message is not in response to a 
      PCUpd or PCInitiate message (i.e. without the SRP object in the PCRpt message).
      </t>

    <section title="The PCInitiate message" toc="default">
      <t>The I flag has no meaning in the PCinitiate message <xref target="RFC8281"/> and is ignored.</t>

</section>
<section title="Delegation" toc="default">
<t>Delegation is an operation to grant a PCE temporary rights to modify a
      subset of LSP parameters on one or more LSPs of a PCC as described in
      <xref target="RFC8051"/>. Note that 
      for the delegated LSPs, the PCE can update and mark some object as
      ignored even when the PCC had set the P flag during delegation. Similarly, the PCE can update and mark some object as a must to process even when the PCC had not set the P flag during delegation.</t>
      <t>The PCC MUST acknowledge this by sending the PCRpt message with the P flag set as per the PCE expectation for the corresponding object. In case PCC cannot except this, it would react as per the processing rules of unacceptable update in <xref target="RFC8231"/>.</t>

      </section>
<section title="Unknown Object Handling" toc="default">
  <t>This document updates the handling of unknown objects in stateful PCEP messages as per the setting of P flag in the common object header in a similar way as <xref target="RFC5440"/>, i.e. if a PCEP speaker does not understand an object with the P flag set or
   understands the object but decides to ignore the object, the entire
   stateful PCEP message MUST be rejected and the PCE MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported Object" <xref target="RFC5440"/>. In case the P flag is not set, the PCEP speaker is free to ignore the object and continue with the message processing as defined. </t>
   <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> defined LSP Error Code TLV to be carried in PCRpt message in the LSP object
   to convey error information. This document does not change that procedure. </t>
  </section>
</section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>This documents clarifies how the already existing P and I flag in PCEP common object header could be used during stateful PCEP exchanges. It updates the
        unknown object error handling in stateful PCEP message exchange. These changes on its own do not add any new security concerns. The security considerations identified in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref target="RFC8231"/>, and <xref target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t>As per <xref target="RFC8231"/>, it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions
      only be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across
      PCEs and PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority,
      using Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8253"/> as per the
      recommendations and best current practices in <xref target="RFC7525"/> (unless
      explicitly set aside in <xref target="RFC8253"/>).</t>
