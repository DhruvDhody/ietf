	     <t>RFC 8231 describes a set of extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE 
		 and GMPLS Label Switched Paths(LSPs) via PCEP. One of the extensions is the LSP object
		 which includes a Flag field of the length of 12 bits. However, 11 bits of the Flag field
		 have already been assigned in RFC 8231, RFC 8281 and RFC 8623. </t>

         <t>This document proposes to define a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV for the LSP object for an extended flag field.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	
	<t><xref target="RFC5440"></xref> describes the Path Computation Element 
    Protocol (PCEP) which is used between a Path Computation Element (PCE) 
    and a Path Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to enable computation 
    of Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label 
    Switched Path (TE LSP). </t>
	
	<t>PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"></xref> 
	describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of MPLS-TE and 
	Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels. One of the extensions is the LSP object
	which contains a flag field; bits in the flag field are used to indicate delegation, syncronization, removal, etc.</t>
	
	<t>As defined in <xref target="RFC8231"></xref>, the length of the flag field is
	12 bits and the value from bit 5 to bit 11 is used for operational, administrative, 
	remove, synchronize and delegate bits respectively. The bit value 4 is assigned in <xref target="RFC8281"></xref> 
	for create for PCE-Initiated LSPs. The bits from 1 to 3 is assigned in <xref target="RFC8623"></xref> for Explicit Route Object (ERO)-compression, 
	fragmentation and Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) respectively. Almost all bits of the Flag field has been assigned 
	already. Thus, it is required to extend the flag field for the LSP Object for future use.</t>
	
    <t>This document proposes to define a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV for an extended flag field in the LSP object.</t>
