    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
      Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
      (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths in 
      SR networks.</t>

      <t>Stateful PCE provide active control of
   MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a model where the PCC
   delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the
   PCE.  Further, stateful PCE could also create and delete 
   PCE-initiated LSPs itself. A PCE-based central controller (PCECC)
   simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it
   with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and without necessarily completely replacing it.</t>

      <t>In some use cases, such as PCECC, Binding Segment Identifier (SID), SR Path 
        Identification, there is a requirement for a
      stateful PCE to make allocation of labels, SID, Path-ID respectively. These 
      use cases require for the PCE to be aware of the various identifier space from
      which to make allocations on behalf of PCC. This documents specify a mechanism
      for a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier space under its control via PCEP. 
      The identifier could be MPLS label, SID, Path ID or another future identifier 
      to be allocated by a PCE.</t>

      <!--may need to dynamically allocate new labels or Segment IDs
      that come from a PCC's label space. However, in the existing documents,
      the label range to be used by a PCE is assumed to to be known and set on
      both PCEP peers, so the mechanism of label range delegation is required.
      This document describes a mechanism to advertise specific PCE controlled
      ID spaces to PCEs via PCEP channel. The type of ID can be MPLS label,
      SRv6 path ID or other ID.</t>-->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> defines the stateless Path Computation
      Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for Path Computation Elements
      (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation
      Clients (PCCs) requests. For supporting stateful operations, <xref
      target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable
      stateful control of LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance
      with <xref target="RFC4657"/>. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC8281"/>
      describes the setup, maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs
      under the stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration
      on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network that is centrally
      controlled and deployed. </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8283"/> introduces the architecture for PCE as a
      central controller, it examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP
      as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the
      implications for the protocol. Also, <xref
      target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/> specifies the
      procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the central
      controller, where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label
      forwarding entries are downloaded through extending PCEP.
      However, the document assumes that
   label range to be used by a PCE is known and set on both PCEP peers.
   This extension adds the capability to advertise the range
   via a PCEP extension.</t>

        <!--these documents do not describe the mechanisms for PCEs to
      manage the space of MPLS label and allocate MPLS label for each of the
      routers that it controls. The label range to be used by a PCE is assumed
      to be known and set on both PCEP peers <xref
      target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/>.</t>-->

      <t>Similarly, <xref
      target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/> specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   when a PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the
   forwarding actions on the routers (SR SID distribution in this case), in addition to computing the paths
   for packet flows in a segment routing network and telling the edge
   routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the
   network. However, the document assumes that
   label range to be used by a PCE is known and set on both PCEP peers.
   This extension adds the capability to advertise the range (from SRGB or SRLB of the node)
   via a PCEP extension.</t>


   <t>[I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment] defines a procedure for path ID in PCEP for SR 
        by defining the PATH-ID TLV. The path
      ID can be a path segment in SR-MPLS <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, or a path ID in SRv6
      <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/>, or other IDs that
      can identify an SR path. This document specify the extension to support
      advertisement of the various ID space to the PCE to control.</t>

      <t>The usecase are described in <xref target="use"/>. The
      ID space range information can be advertised via the TLVs in the Open
      message. The detailed procedures will be described in <xref target="pro"/>, and the
      objects' format will be introduced in <xref target="obj"/>.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This memo makes use of the terms defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref target="RFC8231"/>, <xref target="RFC8283"/>
      and <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use cases" anchor="use">
      <section title="PCE-based Central Control">
        <t>A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be
   calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also
   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies
   as much as possible.</t>
   <t><xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/> describe a 
      mode where LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at
   each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be
   told what label forwarding instructions to program and what resources
   to reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP. 
   For this to work, the PCE-based controller will take responsibility for
   managing some part of the MPLS label space for each of the routers
   that it controls as described in section 3.1.2. of
   <xref target="RFC8283"/>. A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE
   of such a label space to control is needed within PCEP.</t>
   <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to PCEP that
   allow a stateful PCE to compute, update or initiate SR-TE paths. 
   <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/> describes the
   mechanism for PCECC to allocate and
   provision the node/prefix/adjacency label (SID) via PCEP. To make such allocation
   PCE needs to be aware of the label space from Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) or Segment Routing Local Block
   (SRLB) <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/> of the node that it controls. A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE
   of such a label space to control is needed within PCEP. The full SRGB/SRLB of a node could be learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism.</t> 
      </section>

      <section title="Binding SID Allocation">
        <t>The headend of an SR Policy binds a binding SID to its policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>. 
        The instantiation of which may
        involve a list of SIDs. Currently binding SID are allocated by the node, but there is an inherent advantage in
        the binding SID to be allocated by a PCE to allow SR policies to be
        dynamically created, updated according to the network status and operations. 
        Therefore, a PCE needs to obtain the authority and control to allocate
        binding SID actively from the PCC's label space as described in above use case.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Path ID Allocation">
        <t>Path identification is needed for several use cases such as
      performance measurement in Segment Routing (SR) network. For identifying an SR path, <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/> introduces a new segment that is referred to
   as Path Segment, and <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/> introduces the path ID in SRv6.</t>

   <t>[I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment] defines a procedure for path ID in PCEP for SR. It describes a mode in which PCE
    could allocate path ID and inform the ingress and egress PCC. To make such an allocation a PCE needs to be aware of the path ID space
    under its control. A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of such a path ID space is needed within PCEP.</t>

        <!--<t>An SR path ID will be allocated dynamically triggered by a SR path
        computation. A PCE needs to obtain the authority so that it can
        allocate path IDs actively from the PCC's specific path ID space.</t>-->

    </section>

    <section title="Overview" anchor="pro">
      <t>During PCEP Initialization Phase, Open messages are exchanged
      between PCCs and PCEs. The OPEN object may also contain a set of TLVs
   used to convey capabilities in the Open message. The ID could be a MPLS label, 
   SRv6 path ID or any other future ID space for PCE to allocate. 
   A PCC can include a corresponding ID-CONTROL-SPACE TLVs, in the
   OPEN Object to inform the corresponding ID space information that it 
   wants the PCE to control. This TLV MUST NOT be included by the PCE and MUST be ignored on receipt by a PCC.
   This is an optional TLV, the PCE could be aware of the ID space from some other means outside of PCEP.</t>  


      <t>For delegating multiple types of ID space, multiple TLVs corresponding to each ID type
      MUST be included in a Open message. Each TLV (corresponding to each ID type) SHOULD be
      included only once in a Open Message. On receipt, only the first instance is processed and others MUST be ignored. The ID type can be MPLS label,
      SRv6 path ID <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/> or
      other ID. 
      The following ID-CONTROL-SPACE TLVs are defined in this document -
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>LABEL-CONTROL-SPACE - for MPLS Labels (including for SR-MPLS)</t>
        <t>SRv6-PATH-ID-CONTROL-SPACE - for SRv6 Path ID</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>The procedure of ID space control to PCE is shown below:</t>

      <t>If the ID space control procedure is successful, the PCE will return a KeepAlive
      message to the PCC. If there is any error in processing the corresponding TLV,
      an Error (PCErr) message will be sent to the PCC with Error-Type=1 (PCEP session establishment failure) and
      Error-value=TBD (ID space control failure).</t>

      <t>After this process, a stateful PCE can learn the PCE controlled ID
      spaces of a node (PCC) under its control. A PCE can then allocate IDs within the
      control ID space. For example, a PCE can actively allocate labels and download forwarding instructions for the 
      PCECC LSP as described in <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/>. A PCE can also allocate
      labels from SRGB/SRLB for PCECC-SR <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>, binding segments, 
      and path segments <xref target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>. The full SRGB/SRLB of a node could be learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism.
      Similarly a PCE can allocate SRv6 Path ID <xref

      SRv6 Path ID space under its control.</t>

          <t>The SRv6-PATH-ID-CONTROL-SPACE TLV is an optional TLV for use in the
          OPEN object, and its format is shown in the following figure:</t>

          <t>The type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBA. The length field (16
          bits) and has a variable value.</t>

          <t>Flags (32 bits): is of same format as LABEL-CONTROL-SPACE TLV. Any bits assigned in the LABEL-CONTROL-SPACE TLV are also applicable for this.</t>

          <!--<t><list style="symbols">
              <t>A-flag: All Space flag, set when all the ID space is
              delegated to a PCE. When A-flag is set, the pair of Start and
              End SHOULD NOT appear unless PCC needs to notify the entire ID
              space to a PCE.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The rest bits of Flags field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and
          MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>-->
          <t>Start(i) (32 bits): indicates the beginning of the SRv6 Path ID block i.</t>

          <t>Range(i) (32 bits): indicates the range of the SRv6 Path ID block i.</t>

          <t>The number of Path ID blocks can be calculated according to the
          length field in the TLV. Given the controlled ID spaces, a stateful PCE can
          actively allocate path IDs to SRv6 paths from the
          controlled ID spaces as described in [I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment]. </t>

    <section title="Other Considerations" anchor="other">
      <t>In case of multiple PCEs, a PCC MAY decide to give control over different ID space to each instance of the PCE. In case a PCC includes the same ID space to multiple PCEs, the PCE SHOULD use synchronization mechanism (such as <xref target="I-D.litkowski-pce-state-sync"/>) to avoid allocating the same ID. </t>
