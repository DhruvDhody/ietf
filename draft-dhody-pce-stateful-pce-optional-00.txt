1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated
   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.

   [RFC5440] defined P flag (Processing-Rule) as part of Common Object
   Header to allow a PCC to specify in a PCReq message sent to a PCE

   whether the object must be taken into account by the PCE during path
   computation or is just optional.  The I flag (Ignore) is used by a
   PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC whether or not an
   optional object was processed.  Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specified that
   P and I flags of the PCEP objects defined in [RFC8231] is to be set
   to 0 on transmission and ignored on receipt since they are
   exclusively related to path computation requests.  The behavior for P
   and I flag in other objects defined in [RFC5440] and other extension
   was not specified.  This document clarifies how the P and I flag
   could be used in the stateful PCE model to identify optional objects
   in the Path Computation State Report (PCRpt), the Path Computation
   Update Request (PCUpd) and the LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate)
   message.

   This document updates [RFC8231] with respect to usage of P and I flag
   as well as handling of unknown objects in stateful PCEP message
   exchanges.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

   [RFC5440] describes the handling on unknown objects as per the
   setting of the P flag for the PCReq message.  Further [RFC8231]
   defined the usage of LSP Error Code TLV in PCRpt message in response
   to failed LSP Update Request via PCUpd message (for example, due to
   an unsupported object or a TLV).

   This document clarifies the procedure for marking some objects as
   optional to be processed by the PCEP peer in the stateful PCEP
   messages.  Further this document updates the procedure for handling
   unknown objects in the stateful PCEP messages based on the P flag.

2.1.  Usage Example

   The PCRpt message is used to report the current state of an LSP.  As
   part of the message both the <intended-attribute-list> and <actual-
   attribute-list> is encoded.  The <intended-attribute-list> could
   include the METRIC object to indicate a limiting constraint (B flag
   set) for the Path Delay Variation metric [RFC8233].  In some
   scenarios it would be useful to state that this limiting constraint
   can be relaxed by the PCE, in case it cannot find a path.  Similarly

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-OPT                    March 2018


   in case of an association groups [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]
   such as Disjoint Association [I-D.ietf-pce-association-diversity],
   the PCE may need to completely relax the disjointness constraint in
   order to provide a path to all the LSPs that are part of the
   association.  In these case it would be useful mark the objects as
   optional and could be ignored by the PCEP peer.  Also it would be
   used for the PCEP speaker to learn if the PCEP peer has relaxed the
   constraint and ignored the processing of the PCEP object.

   Thus, this document simply clarifies how the already existing P and I
   flag in PCEP common object header could be used during stateful PCEP
   exchanges.

3.  PCEP Extention

3.1.  STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV

   A PCEP speaker indicates its ability to support for handling P and I
   flag during the stateful PCEP message exchanges during the PCEP
   initialization phase, as follows.  When the PCEP session is created,
   it sends an Open message with an OPEN object that contains the
   STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV, as defined in [RFC8231].  A new flag,
   the R (RELAX) flag, is introduced to this TLV to indicate support for
   relaxing the processing of some objects via the use of P and I flag
   in PCEP common object header.

   R (RELAX bit - TBD1): If set to 1 by a PCEP Speaker, the R flag
   indicates that the PCEP Speaker is willing to send and receive PCEP
   objects with handling of P and I flags in the PCEP common object
   header.  In case the bit is unset, it indicates that the PCEP Speaker
   would not handle P and I flags in the PCEP common object header.

   The R flag must be set by both a PCC and a PCE for handling of P and
   I flag in the PCEP common object header to allow relaxing some
   constraints by marking objects as optional to process.  If the PCEP
   speaker that did not set R flag but receives PCEP objects with P or I
   bit set, would behave as per the processing rule in [RFC8231].

3.2.  Handling of P flag

3.2.1.  The PCRpt message

   The P flag in the PCRpt message [RFC8231] allows a PCC to specify to
   a PCE whether the object must be taken into account by the PCE
   (during path computation or re-optimization) or is just optional.
   When the P flag is set, the object MUST be taken into account by the
   PCE.  Conversely, when the P flag is cleared, the object is optional
   and the PCE is free to ignore it.  The P flag for the mandatory

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-OPT                    March 2018


   objects LSP and ERO (intended path) MUST be set in the PCRpt message.
   If the mandatory object is received with the P flag set incorrectly
   according to the rules stated above, the receiving peer MUST send a
   PCErr message with Error-Type=10 (Reception of an invalid object) and
   Error-value=1 (reception of an object with P flag not set).  By
   default, the PCC SHOULD set the P flag, unless a local configuration
   or local policy indicates that some constraints (corresponding PCEP
   objects) can be marked as optional and could be ignored by the PCE.

3.2.2.  The PCUpd message and the PCInitiate message

   The P flag in the PCUpd message [RFC8231] and the PCInitiate message
   [RFC8281] allows a PCE to specify to a PCC whether the object must be
   taken into account by the PCC (during path setup) or is just
   optional.  When the P flag is set, the object MUST be taken into
   account by the PCC.  Conversely, when the P flag is cleared, the
   object is optional and the PCC is free to ignore it.  The P flag for
   the mandatory objects SRP, LSP and ERO (intended path) MUST be set in
   the PCUpd message.  If the mandatory object is received with the P
   flag set incorrectly according to the rules stated above, the
   receiving peer MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type=10
   (Reception of an invalid object) and Error-value=1 (reception of an
   object with P flag not set).  By default, the PCE SHOULD set the P
   flag, unless a local configuration or local policy indicates that
   some constraints (corresponding PCEP objects) can be marked as
   optional and could be ignored by the PCC.

3.3.  Handling of I flag

3.3.1.  The PCUpd message

   The I flag in the PCUpd message [RFC8231] allows a PCE to indicate to
   a PCC whether or not an optional object was processed.  The PCE MAY
   include the ignored optional object in its update request and set the
   I flag to indicate that the optional object was ignored.  When the I
   flag is cleared, the PCE indicates that the optional object was
   processed.  Note that for the delegated LSPs, the PCE can update and
   mark some object as ignored even when the PCC had set the P flag
   during delegation.

3.3.2.  The PCRpt message

   The I flag in the PCRpt message [RFC8231] allows a PCC to indicate to
   a PCE whether or not an optional object was processed in response to
   an LSP Update Request.  The PCC MAY include the ignored optional
   object in its report and set the I flag to indicate that the optional
   object was ignored at PCC.  When the I flag is cleared, the PCC
   indicates that the optional object was processed.  The I flag has no

   meaning if the PCRpt message is not in response to a PCUpd or
   PCInitiate message.

3.3.3.  The PCInitiate message

   The I flag has no meaning in the PCinitiate message [RFC8281].

3.4.  Unknown Object Handling

   This document updates the handling of unknown objects in stateful
   PCEP messages as per the setting of P flag in the common object
   header in the same way as [RFC8231].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231] and [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] in itself.

   Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like [RFC8253].  Also extra care needs to be taken by the
   implementation with respect to POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding,
   verifying and applying these policy variables.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   The following TLV Type Indicator values are requested within the
   "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" subregistry of the "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry:

   Value     Description                 Reference

   TBD2      POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV       [This I.D.]

6.  Manageability Considerations

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at
   PCEP peers and associate it with the LSPs.  They MAY also allow
   configuration to related policy parameters, in which case the an
   operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to
   parse the associated policy parameters TLV.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-OPT                    March 2018


6.2.  Information and Data Models

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG
   configured.  Further implementation SHOULD allow to view the current
   set of LSPs in the PAG.  To serve this purpose, the PCEP YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] includes association groups and can be used
   for PAG.

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

6.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

6.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

6.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
