1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated
   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.

   [RFC5440] defined P flag as part of Common Object Header to allow a
   PCC to specify in a PCReq message sent to a PCE whether the object
   must be taken into account by the PCE during path computation or is
   just optional.  The I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to
   indicate to a PCC whether or not an optional object was processed.
   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specified that P and I flags of the PCEP
   objects defined in [RFC8231] MUST be set to 0 on transmission and
   SHOULD be ignored on receipt since they are exclusively related to
   path computation requests.  The behavior for P and I flag in other
   objects defined in [RFC5440] and other extension was not specified.
   This document clarifies how the P and I flag could be used in

   stateful PCE model to identify optional objects in the Path
   Computation State Report (PCRpt), the Path Computation Update Request
   (PCUpd) and the LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Motivation

   The stateful PCE introduces following new messages:

      Path Computation State Report (PCRpt):

3.  Overview

4.  PCEP Extention

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231] and [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] in itself.

   Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like [RFC8253].  Also extra care needs to be taken by the
   implementation with respect to POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding,
   verifying and applying these policy variables.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   The following TLV Type Indicator values are requested within the
   "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" subregistry of the "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry:

   Value     Description                 Reference

   TBD2      POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV       [This I.D.]

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at
   PCEP peers and associate it with the LSPs.  They MAY also allow
   configuration to related policy parameters, in which case the an
   operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to
   parse the associated policy parameters TLV.

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG
   configured.  Further implementation SHOULD allow to view the current
   set of LSPs in the PAG.  To serve this purpose, the PCEP YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] includes association groups and can be used
   for PAG.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
