    <abstract>
      <t>When a Path Computation Element (PCE) is a Label Switching Router
      (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a
      server participating in the IGP, its presence and path computation
      capabilities can be advertised using IGP flooding. The IGP extensions
      for PCE discovery (RFC 5088 and RFC 5089) define a method to advertise
      path computation capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF and IS-IS
      respectively. However these specifications lack a method to advertise
      PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) security (e.g., Transport Layer
      Security (TLS), TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)) support
      capability.</t>

      <t>This document defines capability flag bits for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS
      sub-TLV that can be announced as an attribute in the IGP advertisement
      to distribute PCEP security support information. In addition, this
      document updates RFC 5088 and RFC 5089 to allow advertisement of a Key
      ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV to support TCP-AO security capability.
      Further, this document updates RFC 8231, and RFC 8306.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, Path Computation Element Communication
      Protocol (PCEP) communication privacy and integrity
      are important issues, as an attacker that intercepts a PCEP message
      could obtain sensitive information
      related to computed paths and resources. Authentication and integrity checks
      allow the receiver of a PCEP
   message to know that the message genuinely comes from the node that
   purports to have sent it and to know whether the message has been
   modified.</t>

      <t>Among the possible solutions mentioned in that document, Transport
      Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8446"/> provides support for peer
      authentication, and message encryption and integrity while TCP
      Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925"/> and
      Cryptographic Algorithms for TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5926"/> offer
      significantly improved security for applications using TCP. As specified
      in section 4 of <xref target="RFC8253"/>, in order for a Path
      Computation Client (PCC) to establish a connection with a PCE server
      using TLS or TCP-AO, the PCC needs to know whether PCE server supports
      TLS or TCP-AO as a secure transport.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/> define a method
      to advertise path computation capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF
      and IS-IS respectively. However, these specifications lack a method to
      advertise PCEP security (e.g., TLS) support capability.</t>

      <t>This document defines capability flag bits for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS
      sub-TLV that can be announced as attributes in the IGP advertisement to
      distribute PCEP security support information. In addition, this document
      updates <xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/> to allow advertisement of a Key ID or
      Key Chain Name Sub-TLV to support TCP-AO security capability.</t>

      <t>As per <xref target="RFC5088"/>, the IANA created a top-level OSPF registry, the
      "Path Computation Element (PCE) Capability Flags" registry. This
      document updates <xref target="RFC5088"/> and moves the registry to "Interior Gateway
      Protocol (IGP) Parameters". <xref target="RFC5089"/> states that the IS-IS uses the
      same registry as OSPF. This document updates <xref target="RFC5089"/> to refer to
      the new IGP registry.
      Further, this document updates <xref target="RFC8231"/>
      where it references the registry location as "Open Shortest Path First
      (OSPF) Parameters" registry to "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
      Parameters" registry. This document updates [RFC8306] where it uses the
      term "OSPF PCE Capability Flag" and request assignment from OSPF
      Parameters registry with "PCE Capability Flag" and the IGP Parameters
      registry.</t>

      <t>Note that <xref target="RFC5557"/> uses the term "OSPF registry" instead of the "IGP
      registry" whereas <xref target="RFC8623"/> and <xref target="RFC9168"/> uses the term "OSPF
      Parameters" instead of "IGP Parameters".</t>

      <t>Note that the PCEP Open message exchange is another way to discover
      PCE capabilities information, but in this instance, the TCP security
      related key parameters need to be known before the PCEP session is
      established and the PCEP Open messages are exchanged. Thus, the use of
      the PCE discovery and capabilities advertisement of the IGP needs to be
      leveraged.</t>

    <section title="IGP extension for PCEP security capability support">
      <t><xref target="RFC5088"/> defines a PCE Discovery (PCED) TLV carried
      in an OSPF Router Information Link State Advertisement (LSA) as defined
      in <xref target="RFC7770"/> to facilitate PCE discovery using OSPF. This
      document defines two capability flag bits in the OSPF PCE Capability
      Flags to indicate TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) support <xref
      target="RFC5925"/><xref target="RFC5926"/> and PCEP over TLS support
      <xref target="RFC8253"/> respectively.</t>

      <t>Similarly, <xref target="RFC5089"/> defines the PCED sub-TLV for use
      in PCE discovery using IS-IS. This document will use the same flag for
      the OSPF PCE Capability Flags sub-TLV to allow IS-IS to indicate TCP
      Authentication Option (TCP-AO) support, PCEP over TLS support
      respectively.</t>

      <t>The IANA assignments for shared OSPF and IS-IS Security Capability
      Flags are documented in <xref target="cap"/> ("PCE Capability Flags") of
      this document.</t>

      <section title="Use of PCEP security capability support for PCE discovery">

        <t>A client's configuration MAY indicate that support for a given
        security capability is required. If a client is configured to require
        that its PCE server supports TCP-AO, the client MUST verify that the
        TCP-AO flag bit in the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV for a given server is set
        before it opens a connection to that server. Similarly, if the client
        is configured to require that its PCE server supports TLS, the client
        MUST verify that the PCEP over TLS support flag bit in the
        PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV for a given server is set before it opens a

      <t>This introduction of additional sub-TLVs should be viewed as an

      obsoleted by TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5925"/> because of security concerns. However,
      TCP-AO is not widely implemented and so it is, therefore, RECOMMENDED
      (per <xref target="RFC8253"/> which updates <xref target="RFC5440"/>) that PCEP is secured using TLS.
      An implementation SHOULD offer at least one of the two
      security capabilities defined in this document.</t>

      <t>The information related to PCEP security is sensitive and due care
      needs to be taken by the operator. This document defines new capability
      bits that are susceptible to a downgrade attack by setting them to zero.
      The content of Key ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV can be altered to enable
      an on-path attack. Thus, before advertising the PCEP security
      parameters, using the mechanism described in this document, the IGP MUST
      be known to provide authentication and integrity for the PCED TLV using
      the mechanisms defined in <xref target="RFC5304"/>, <xref target="RFC5310"/> or <xref target="RFC5709"/>.</t>

      <t>Moreover, as stated in the Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC5088"/> and
      <xref target="RFC5089"/>, there are no mechanisms defined in OSPF or IS-IS to protect
      the confidentiality of the PCED TLV. For this reason, the operator must
      ensure that no private data is carried in the TLV, e.g. that key-ids or
      key-chain names do not reveal sensitive information about the
      network.</t>

        <t>IANA is requested to move the "Path Computation Element (PCE)
        Capability Flags" registry from the "Open Shortest Path First v2
        (OSPFv2) Parameters" grouping to the "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
        Parameters" grouping.</t>

        <t>IANA is requested to make the following additional assignments from
        the "Path Computation Element (PCE) Capability Flags" registry.</t>

      <section title="PCED sub-TLV Type Indicators">
        <t>The PCED sub-TLVs were defined in <xref target="RFC5088"/> and
        <xref target="RFC5089"/>, but they did not create a registry for it.
        This document requests IANA to create a new registry called "PCED
        sub-TLV type indicators" under the "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
        Parameters" grouping. The registration policy for this registry is
        "Standards Action" <xref target="RFC8126"/>. Values in this registry come from the range
        0-65535.</t>

        <t>This registry should be populated with:</t>
