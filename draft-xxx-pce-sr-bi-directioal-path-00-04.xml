    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
      Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
      (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths in 
      SR networks.
      </t>

      <t>This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
   unidirectional SR Paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR path when
   using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as
   well as when using a Stateless PCE.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Segment routing (SR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>
      leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms. SR supports to
      steer packets into an explicit forwarding path according to the Segment
      Routing Policy ( SR Policy) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> at the ingress
      node.</t>

      <t>However, the SR Policies defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> only supports
      uni-directional SR paths. For supporting bi-directional paths <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, new SR policies carrying
      Path ID and bi-directional path information are defined in <xref
      target="I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution"/>.</t>

     <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP enables the communication between a Path Computation
      Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE,
      for the purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
      Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.
      </t>

      <t><xref target='RFC8231'></xref>  specifies a
      set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
      control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
      <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing
   and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in
      <xref target='RFC8281'></xref>.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to
      the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> for SR
      networks,
      that allow a stateful PCE to compute and
      initiate SR-TE paths, as well as a PCC to request, report or delegate SR paths. 
      <xref target='I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6'/> extend PCEP 
      to support SR for IPv6 data plane.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> introduces a generic
      mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
      associations between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes, for
      example primary and secondary LSP associations, and is equally
      applicable to the active and passive modes of a Stateful PCE <xref
      target="RFC8231"/> or a stateless PCE <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> defines PCEP
      extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an
      Associated Bidirectional LSP when using a Stateful PCE for both
      PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when using a Stateless
      PCE.</t>

      <t>This document extends the bidirectional association to segment routing by 
        specifying PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
      unidirectional SR paths into a bi-directional SR path.</t>
      
      <t>[I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment] defines a procedure for path ID in PCEP for SR 
        by defining the PATH-ID TLV. The path
      ID can be a path segment in SR-MPLS <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, or a path ID in SRv6
      <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/>, or other IDs that
      can identify an SR path. The PATH-ID MUST be included for associated bidirectional SR paths.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This memo makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>. The reader is assumed to be
      familiar with the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref
      target="RFC8231"/>, <xref target="RFC8281"/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PCEP Extension for Bi-directional SR Path">
      <t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>, LSPs are associated by adding them
   to a common association group. <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> specifies PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
   unidirectional MPLS-TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP for
   both single-sided and double-sided initiation cases by defining two new
   Bidirectional LSP Association Groups.</t>

   <t>This document extends the procedure for SR bidirectional associated paths by defining 
    a new bidirectional association type (i.e. Double-sided Bi-directional SR
      Path Association Group). The document further describe the 
      mechanism of associating two unidirectional SR path into a bidirectional SR path. 
      [I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment] defines a procedure for path ID in PCEP for SR 
      by defining the PATH-ID TLV. The bidirectional SR path MUST also use the PATH-ID TLV. 
      </t>

      <section title="Double-sided Bidirectional SR Path Association Group Object">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>, two
        LSPs are associated as a bi-directional MPLS-TE LSP by a common bi-directional
        LSP association group. For associating two SR paths, this document
        defines a new association group called 'Double-sided Bidirectional SR Path Association Group' as follows: 
        <list style="symbols"><t>Association Type (TBD) = Double-sided Bidirectional SR Path Association
        Group</t></list></t>

   <t>Similar to other bidirectional associations, this Association Type is operator-configured in
   nature and statically created by the operator on the PCEP peers.  The
   paths belonging to this association is conveyed via PCEP messages to
   the PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range TLV
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> MUST NOT be sent for these Association
   Types, and MUST be ignored, so that the entire range of association
   ID can be used for them. The handling of the Association ID, Association Source, optional Global Association
   Source and optional Extended Association ID in this
   association are set in the same way as  <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>

        <t>A member of the Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association
        Group can take the role of a forward or reverse SR path and follows
        the rules similar to the rules defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> for LSPs.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An SR path (forward or reverse) can not be part of more than
            one Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group.</t>
            <t>The endpoints of the SR paths in this associations cannot be different.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For describing the SR paths in this association group, such as
        direction and co-routed information, this association group reuses the
        Bi-directional LSP Association Group TLV defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>. All fields and processing
        rules are as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.

    </section>

    <section title="Bi-directional Flag">
      <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, the B-flag in RP object MUST
      be set when the PCC specifies that the path computation request relates
      to a bi-directional TE LSP. In this document, the B-flag also MUST be
      set when the PCC specifies that the path computation request relates to
      a bi-directional SR path. Likely, when a stateful PCE initiates or
      updates a bi-directional SR paths including LSPs and SR paths, the B-flag
      in SRP object <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls"/> MUST
      be set as well.</t>
    </section>
<section title="Procedures of Bi-directional Path Computation">

      <t>Two uni-directional SR paths can be associated by the association group
      object as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>. A bidirectional 
      LSP association group object is defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> (for MPLS-TE). This documents extends the mechanism for bidirectional SR paths. Two SR paths can be
      associated together by including the Bi-directional SR Path Association Group in the PCEP messages. The PATH-ID TLV
      [draft-li-pce-sr-path-segment] MUST also be included in the LSP object for these SR paths.</t>

      <t>There MAY also be a need to include the reverse direction path in the PCEP messages, to do this the PCE MAY inform the reverse SR path to the ingress PCC and vice versa. To achieve this
        a PCInitiate message for the reverse SR path could be sent to the ingress PCC and a PCInitiate message for the forward SR path to the egress PCC with the same association group. These PCInitiate message MUST not trigger initiation of  SR paths. The information of reverse direction
      path can be used for several scenarios, such as directed BFD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/>.</t> 





      <!--<t>After path computation, the bi-directional path that combined by two
      SR paths and associated by an association group object will be sent to
      the source and destination PCC( as known as the ingress node and egress
      node in SR) by PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate messages, respectively. </t>-->

      <!--<t>A PCEP message such as PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate, containing a
      bi-directional path, sent to the PCC contains a forward direction path
      beginning from itself to the remote PCC and a reverse path from the
      remote PCC back to the PCC itself. The information of reverse direction
      path can be used for several scenarios, such as directed BFD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/>.</t>-->

        <t>As specified in <xref

      <section title="Stateless PCE">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>, for
        a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path computation
        request to an association group, thus enabling it to associate a
        common set of configuration parameters or behaviors with the request.
        A PCC can request co-routed or non co-routed forward and reverse
        direction paths from a stateless PCE for a bidirectional LSP
        association group.</t>
