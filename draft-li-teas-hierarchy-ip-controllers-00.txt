1.  Introduction

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a separation between the
   control elements and the forwarding components so that software
   running in a centralized system called a controller, can act to

   program the devices in the network to behave in specific ways.  A
   required element in an SDN architecture is a component that plans how
   the network resources will be used and how the devices will be
   programmed.  It is possible to view this component as performing
   specific computations to place flows within the network given
   knowledge of the availability of network resources, how other
   forwarding devices are programmed, and the way that other flows are
   routed.  The Application-Based Network Operation (ABNO) [RFC7491]
   describes how various components and technologies fit together.

   A domain [RFC4655] is any collection of network elements within a
   common sphere of address management or path computation
   responsibility.  Specifically within this document we mean a part of
   an operator's network that is under common management.  Network
   elements will often be grouped into domains based on technology
   types, vendor profiles, and geographic proximity and under a domain
   controller.

   Multiple such domains in the network are interconnected, and a path
   is established through a series of connected domains to form an end-
   to-end path over which various services are offered.  Each domain is
   under the control of the domain controller (or lower-level
   controller), and a "super controller" (or high-level controller)
   takes responsibility for a high-level view of the network before
   distributing tasks to domain controllers (or lower-level
   controllers).

   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework] describes the framework for
   Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) as well
   as a set of management and control functions used to operate multiple
   TE networks.  This documents would apply the ACTN principles to
   Hierarchy of IP controllers (HIC) and focus on the applicability and
   interactions with other protocol and technologies (specific to IP
   packet domains).

   Sometimes, service (such as Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN),
   Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN), Ethernet VPN (EVPN),
   Seamless MPLS) require sites attached to different domains (under the
   control of different domain controller) to be interconnected as part
   of the VPN service.  This require multi-domain coordination between
   domain controllers to compute and setup E2E path for the VPN service.

   This document describes the interactions between various IP
   controllers in a hierarchical fashion to provide various IP services.
   It describes how the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered
   Networks (ACTN) framework is applied to the Hierarchy of IP
   controllers (HIC) as well as document the interactions with control
   plane protocols (like BGP, Path Computation Element Communication

   provide end to end dynamic services spanning multiple domains and
   controllers (e.g.  L3VPN, Seamless MPLS etc).

           Figure 1: Example: Hierarchy of IP controllers (HIC)

   The IP "Super Controller" receives request from the network/service
   orchestrator to setup dynamic services spanning multiple domains.
   The IP "Super Controller" breaks down and assigns tasks to the domain
   controllers, responsible for communicating to network devices in the
   domain.  It further coordinates between the controller to provide a
   unified view of the multi-domain network.

2.1.  Mapping to ACTN

   As per [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], ACTN has following main
   functions -

   o  Multi-domain coordination

   o  Virtualization/Abstraction

   o  Customer mapping/translation

   o  Virtual service coordination

   These functions are part of Multi Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
   and/or Provisioning Network Controller (PNC).  Further these
   functions are part of the controller / orchestrator.

   The HIC is an instantiation of ACTN framework for IP packet network.
   The IP domain (lower-level) controllers implements the PNC
   functionalities for configuring, controlling and monitoring the IP
   domain.  The "super controller" (high-level controller) implements
   the MDSC functionalities for coordination between multiple domains as
   well as maintaining an abstracted view of multiple domains.  It also
   takes care of the service related functionalities of customer
   mapping/translation and virtual service coordination.

   The ACTN functions are part of the IP controllers and responsible for
   the TE topology and E2E path computation/setup.  There are other
   functions along with ACTN that are needed to manage multiple IP
   domain networks.

2.2.  Interface between Super Controller and Domain Controller in HIC

   The interaction between super controller and domain controller in HIC
   is a combination of Control Plane and Management Plane interface as
   shown in Figure 2.  BGP [RFC4271] and PCEP [RFC5440] are example of
   the control plane interface; where as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] are example of management plane interface.

       * -> Control Plane Interface
       # -> Management Plane Interface



    Figure 2: Interface between Super Controller and Domain Controller

   Note that ACTN's MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) could be implemented via
   management plane interface using Yang models
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang] or via PCEP control plane interface
   [I-D.ietf-pce-applicability-actn].

3.  Key Concepts

3.1.  Topology

   The Domain Controller is expected to be aware of the topology of the
   network devices in its domain.  The domain controller could
   participate in the IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305]) or use BGP-LS
   [RFC7752] by which link-state and TE information is collected and
   shared with domain controller using the BGP routing protocol.

   An alternate approach would be to rely on the management plane
   interface which uses the YANG model for network/TE Topology as per
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] and [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo].

   The domain controller is expected to share the domain topology to the
   Super Controller as aligned to ACTN (where PNC abstract the topology
   towards MDSC).  A level of abstraction is usually applied while



Li, et al.               Expires August 16, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                     HIC                     February 2018


   presenting the topology to a higher level controller.  Topology
   abstraction is described in [RFC7926] as well as
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework].  BGP-LS, PCEP-LS
   [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls] or management plane interface based on the
   abstracted network/TE Topology could be used to carry the abstract
   topology to the super-controller.  At minimum the border nodes and
   inter-domain links are exposed to the super-controller.

3.2.  Path Computation/Path instantiation

   The Domain Controller is responsible for computing and setup of path
   when the source and destination is in the same domain, otherwise the
   Super Controller coordinates the multi-domain path computation and
   setup with the help of the domain controller.  This is aligned to
   ACTN.

   PCEP [RFC5440] provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements
   (PCEs) [RFC4655] to perform path computations in response to Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  Since then, the role and
   function of the PCE has grown to allow delegated control [RFC8231]
   and PCE-initiated use of network resources [RFC8281].

   Further, [RFC6805] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce] describes a
   hierarchy of PCE with Parent PCE coordinating multi-domain path
   computation function between Child PCE(s).  This fits well with HIC
   as described in this document.

   Note that a management plane interface which uses the YANG model for
   path computation/setup ([I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]) could be used in place of PCEP.

3.3.  BGP considerations

   [RFC4456] describes the concept of route-reflection where a "route
   reflector" (RR) reflects the routes to avoid full mesh connection
   between Internal BGP (IBGP) peers.  The IP domain controller can play
   the role of RR in its domain.  The super controller can further act
   as RR to towards the domain controller.

   [Editor's Note: To do - BGP policy, BGP Flowspec.  Maybe a BGP expert
   can add details here!]

   [Editor's Note: Is there a role of BMP here?]

4.  VPN Service

4.1.  L3VPN

   A Layer 3 IP VPN service is a collection of sites that are authorized
   to exchange traffic between each other over a shared IP
   infrastructure.  [RFC4110] provides a framework for Layer 3 Provider-
   Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs).  [RFC8299] provides a
   L3VPN service delivery YANG model for PE-based VPNs.  The Super
   controller is expected to implement the L3SM model and translate it
   to network models towards the domain controller, which in terns
   translate it to the device model.  See [RFC8309] for more details.

                              Figure 3: L3VPN

   Based on the user data in L3SM model, the network configurations need
   to be trickle down to the network device to setup the L3VPN.

   Based on the QoS or Policy requirement for the L3VPN service, the
   Super Controller may -

   o  Set the tunnel selection policy at the PE/ASBR routers so that
      they could select the existing tunnels

   o  Select an existing tunnels at the controller level and bind it to
      the VPN service

   o  Initiate the process of creating a new tunnel based on the QoS
      requirement and bind it the VPN service

   o  Initiate the process of creating a new tunnel based on the the
      policy

   Refer [I-D.lee-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] for more details from
   ACTN perspective.

   Apart from the Management plane interface based on respective YANG
   models, the control plane interface PCEP could be used for path
   computation and setup.

4.2.  Seamless MPLS

   Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] describes an architecture
   which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and
   core/aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain.In the seamless
   MPLS for mobile backhaul, since there are multiple domains including
   the core network and multiple mobile backhaul networks, for each
   domain there is a domain controller.  In order to implement the end-
   to-end network service provision, there should be coordination among
