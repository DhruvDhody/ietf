    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
      functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</t>

      <t>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture
      describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through
      an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm. A Segment
      Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an
      IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path
      Computation Element (PCE).</t>

      <t>Path identification is needed for several use cases such as
      performance measurement in Segment Routing (SR) network. This document
      specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) to
      support requesting, replying, reporting and updating the path identifier
      between PCEP speakers.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
      purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE
      LSP) characteristics.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
      enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
      compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to
      effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref
      target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller"/>
      specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as
      the central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as
      explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.</t>

      <t>Segment routing (SR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>
      leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms and supports
      steering packets into an explicit forwarding path at the ingress
      node.</t>

      <t>An SR path needs to be identified in some use cases such as
      performance measurement. For identifying an SR path, <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/> introduces a new segment
      that is referred to as Path Segment.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to
      the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      for SR networks, that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate SR-TE
      paths, as well as a PCC to request, report or delegate SR paths. <xref
      target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> extend PCEP to support SR
      for IPv6 data plane.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>
      specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions when a PCE-based
      controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on
      the routers (SR SID distribution in this case), in addition to computing
      the paths for packet flows in a segment routing network and telling the
      edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the
      network.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to carry the SR path
      identification information in PCEP messages <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      <xref target="RFC8231"/> <xref target="RFC8281"/>. The path ID can be a
      path segment in SR-MPLS <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, or a path ID in SRv6
      <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/>, or other IDs that
      can identify the SR path. This document also extends the PCECC-SR
      mechanism to inform the path ID to the egress PCC.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This memo makes use of the terms defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>, and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>.</t>

    <section title="Overview of Path ID Extensions in PCEP">
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism of encoding (and allocating) path
      ID (path segment in case of MPLS, path ID in case of IPv6, etc) in PCEP
      extensions. For supporting path ID in PCEP, several TLVs and flags are
      defined. The formats of the objects and TLVs are described in <xref
      target="obj"/>. The procedures of path ID allocation are described in
      <xref target="pro"/>.</t>

      <t>There are various modes of operations, such as - <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The path ID can be allocated by Egress PCC. The PCE should
          request the Path ID from Egress PCC.</t>

          <t>The path ID can be allocated by Ingress PCC itself and informed
          to the PCE. The PCE can then inform the egress PCC.</t>

          <t>Ingress PCC can also request PCE to allocate the path ID, in this
          case, the PCE would allocate and inform the assigned path ID to the
          ingress/egress PCC using PCEP messages.</t>

          <t>The PCE can allocate a path ID on its own accord and inform the
          ingress/egress PCC , useful for PCE-initiated LSPs.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The path information to the ingress PCC and PCE is exchanged via an
      extension to <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/>. The path ID information to
      the egress PCC is informed via an extension to the PCECC-SR procedures
      <xref target="I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr"/>.</t>

      <t>For the PCE to allocate a path ID, the PCE SHOULD be aware of the
      path ID space from the PCCs. This is done via mechanism as described in
      <xref target="I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space"/>. Otherwise, the PCE
      should request the egress PCC of Path IDs.</t>

          <t>If the label space is maintained by PCC itself, and the path ID
          is allocated by Egress PCC, then the PCE should request the Path ID
          from Egress PCC. In this case, the PCE should send a PCUpdate or
          PCInitiate message with the PATH-ID TLV in LSP object to the egress
          PCC to request the path ID. The P-flag in LSP should be unset in
          this case.</t>

          <t>If the path ID is allocated by the ingress node, a PATH-ID TLV
          MUST be included in a LSP object (with E-bit unset) in the PCEP
          message from PCC. The L-flag is set if the path ID has local
          significance. In this case, the P flag in LSP object is set to
          0.</t>

          <t>If the PCC requests the path ID to be allocated by the PCE, P
          flag in LSP object is set to 1 and Path ID TLV MAY be skipped. After
          the PCE has allocated a path ID, it MUST include the PATH-ID TLV in
          a LSP object, the E-bit is set by PCE based on the path ID space
          from which the allocation is made.</t>

          <t>If the PCE allocated the path ID on its own accord, a PATH-ID TLV

          <t>As defined in <xref
          target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, a path segment/ID can
          be allocated by the egress PCC. In this case, the ID/label space may
          be maintained on the PCC.</t>

          <t>Receiving a stateful path computation request with path ID
          allocation request from an ingress PCC, or initiating or updating an
          LSP with path ID actively, a PCE requests the egress PCC to allocate
          a path ID if the PCE does not have the permission to allocate path
          IDs from the delegeted ID space directly or the ID/label space is
          maintained by the egress PCC itself.</t>

          <t>The mechanism of Path ID request and reply may be achieved by
          extensions of PCInitiate and PCUpd message.</t>

          <t>The PATH-ID TLV MUST be included in an LSP object in the
          PCInitiate message sent from the PCE to the egress. The P flag in
          LSP object MUST be set to 0.</t>

          <t>If the value of path ID is 0, it indicates that the PCE is
          requesting a path ID for this LSP. If the Path ID is n, it indicates
          that the PCE requests a specific value n of path ID. If the path ID
          is allocated successfully, the egress PCC should report the path ID
          via PCRpt message with PATH-ID TLV in LSP object. Else, it MUST send
          a PCErr message with Error-Type = TBD ("Path SID failure") and Error
          Value = TBD ("Invalid SID"). If the value of path ID is valid, but
          the PCC is unable to allocate the path ID, it MUST send a PCErr
          message with Error-Type = TBD ("Path label/SID failure") and Error
          Value = TBD ("Unable to allocate the specified label/SID").</t>

          <t>Once the PCE receives the PCRpt message, it can obtain the Path
          ID information and then update the path with path ID or reply the
          ingress PCC the path information with path ID.</t>

          <t>If the LSP is installed corretly, then a PCRpt message will be
          sent back to the PCE. If the LSP can not be installed corretly, then
          a PCErr message will be sent back to the PCE. The PCE should
          withdraw the path ID allocation by sending a PCUpd message to remove
          the LSP and associated path ID. If the path ID update is failure ,
          the PCE should send a PCUpd message to synchronize with the egress
          PCC.</t>

          <t>If a PCC wishes to withdraw or modify a previously reported path
          ID value, it MUST send a PCRpt message without any PATH-ID TLV or
          with the PATH-ID TLV containing the new path ID respectively.</t>

          <t>If a PCE wishes to modify a previously requested path ID value,
          it MUST send a PCUpd message with PATH-ID TLV containing the new
          path ID value. Absense of PATH-ID TLV in PCUpd message means that
          the PCE withdraw the path ID.</t>

          <t>If a PCC receives a valid path ID value from a PCE which is
          different than the current path ID, it MUST try to allocate the new
          value. If the new path ID is successfully allocated, the PCC MUST
          report the new value to the PCE. Otherwise, it MUST send a PCErr
          message with Error-Type = TBD ("Path label/SID failure") and Error
          Value = TBD ("Unable to allocate the specified label/SID").</t>

      <section title="Two Label Solution">
        <t><xref target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/> describe a Path
        Segment to uniquely identify an SR path in a specific context. (e.g.,
        in the context of the egress node or ingress node of an SR path, or
        within an SR domain). It further describes two solution based on 'one
        label' or 'two labels' solution. For the latter, two segments (Source
        segment and Path segment) are used to identify an SR path where the
        source segment is a global node segment which can uniquely identify a
        node within the SR domain (it is NOT used for forwarding and indicates
        that a Path segment immediately follows). The combination of Source
        segment and Path segment uniquely identify an SR Path with an SR
        domain.</t>

        <t>The procedure described in this document allocates and encode the
        Path Segment only. It is expected that the Egress PCC is aware of the
        Source segment by some other procedures. These procedures could be
        IGP, PCECC-SR, or some other mechanisms.</t>
