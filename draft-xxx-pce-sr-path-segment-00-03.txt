1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] leverages the
   source routing and tunneling paradigms.  SR supports to steer packets
   into an explicit forwarding path according to the Segment Routing
   Policy ( SR Policy) [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy] at
   the ingress node.

   An SR path needs to be identified in some use cases such as
   performance measurement.  For identifying an SR path,
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], new SR policies carrying Path
   ID are defined in [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

Internet-Draft  Path ID and Bi-didirectional Path in PCEP     April 2018


   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to the Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] that allow a stateful
   PCE [RFC8231] to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths,
   as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s)
   and optimization criteria in SR networks.  However, it does not
   support path ID allocation, so new extensions are required.

   This document specifies a mechanism to carry the SR path
   identification information in PCEP messages [RFC5440] [RFC8231]
   [RFC8281].  The path ID can be a path segment in SR-MPLS
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], or a path ID in SRv6
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np], or other IDs that can
   identify an SR path.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

3.  Overview of Path ID Extensions in PCEP

   This document specifies a mechanism of allocating path ID in PCEP
   extensions.  For supporting path ID allocation in PCEP, several TLVs
   and flags are defined, and the formats of objects and TLVs are
   described in section 4.  The procedures of path ID allocation are
   described in section 5.

4.  Objects and TLVs

4.1.  Open Object

4.1.1.  SR-PATH-ID-ALLOCATION TLV

   This document defines a new SR-PATH-ID-ALLOCATION TLV in Open Object
   to advertise the capability of path ID allocation.

   The SR-PATH-ID-ALLOCATION TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   object for advertising PCE capability of path ID allocation.  Its
   format is shown in the following figure:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   The type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBA.  The length field is 16 bits
   long and has a fixed value of 4.

   The value comprises a single field -- Flags (32 bits), and no flag is
   defined yet.  The Flags field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

4.2.  P-Flag in the RP Object

   The format of the RP object is defined in [RFC5440] and included here
   for easy reference with the addition of the PID-flag and E-flag.

   The definitions of the P-Flag in SRP are identical to the definitions
   in RP object.

4.4.  LSP Object

4.4.1.  Path ID TLV

   The PATH-ID TLV is an optional TLV for use in the LSP Object for path
   ID allocation.  The type of this TLV is to be allocated by IANA.  The
   format is shown below.

                     Figure 4. The PATH-ID Object Format


   The IDT field specifies the type of the ID filed, which carries a
   Path ID corresponding to an SR path.

   o  0: MPLS Path segment, which is an MPLS label as defined in
      [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment].

   o  1: SRv6 Path ID, which is a 4-octet integer as defined in
      [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np].

   Reserved: MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on
   receipt.

   Flags: Two flags are currently defined:

   o  G-Flag: Global flag.  Set when the Path segment/ID is global
      within an SR domain.  When G-flag is set, E-flag should be
      ignored.  In addition, it MUST NOT be set when E-flag is set.

   o  E-Flag: Egress flag for local sgement/ID.  The E-flag is set when
      a path segment/ID is a local segment/ID allocated by the egress
      node.  Else, the path segment/ID is a local segment/ID allocated
      by the ingress node if the G-Flag is not set.  When the G-flag is
      set, meaning the Path segment/ID is global within an SR domain,
      E-flag should be ignored.

Internet-Draft  Path ID and Bi-didirectional Path in PCEP     April 2018


   ID: The path ID of an SR path.  The path ID type is indicated by the
   ID Type field.  It can be a path segment
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] in MPLS label format.  Or it can
   be a 4 octets integer ID as defined in
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] or other IDs that can identify
   a path.

   When the path ID allocation is enable, a PATH-ID TLV MUST be included
   in the LSP object.  If the path ID is allocated by the ingress node,
   a PATH-ID TLV should be included in a LSP object in the PCReq
   message.

5.  Operations

   The rules defined in [RFC8231] and [RFC5440] can apply to this
   document.  For supporting path ID allocation, additional operations
   are defined in this section.

5.1.  Procedures of Path ID Allocation

   This document defines two options of path ID allocation for different
   scenarios.

   Option A is path ID delegation for stateful PCEs, while Optiona B is
   Path ID request and reply for stateless PCEs.

   In option A, ID delegation, PCCs need to advertise their PCE
   controlled ID spaces to a PCE so that the stateful PCE can allocate
   ID directly without requesting ID from PCCs.  In this situation, a
   stateful PCE can allocate the path ID directly instead of requesting
   path IDs from the egress or ingress PCC.  The procedure of path ID
   delegation is described in [draft-li-pce-controlled-id-space].

   In option B, when a path computation with path ID allocation request
   is received by a stateless PCE, the stateless PCE needs to request
   Path IDs from the egress PCC or the ingress PCC.  This path ID
   request and reply can be done by other out-of-band mechanisms such as
   Netconf [RFC6241].  Out-of-band mechanisms are out of scope of this
   document and will be discussed in other documents.

5.1.1.  Stateful PCE

5.1.1.1.  PCE Controlled ID Spaces Advertisement

   For allocating path IDs to SR paths by PCEs, the PCE controlled ID
   Spaces should be advertised to PCEs.  The PCE controlled ID spaces
   advertisement is described in [draft-li-pce-controlled-id-space].

5.1.1.2.  Passive Stateful PCE

   As defined in [RFC8231], a PCC needs to send a PCReq messsage to a
   PCE to request a path computation, and the PCE will reply the PCC the
   path computation result by PCRep message.  After that, the PCC will
   synchronize the states of LSPs to the PCE.  This procedure is called
   as Passive Stateful PCE Path Computation Request/Response.

   In order to allocate path ID for SR paths, a PCC should set the
   SRP.PID flag in PCReq message.  A PCE will computate the SR path
   based on the parameters in PCReq message and then allocate a path ID
   for this SR path.  The path computation result with PATH-ID TLV in a
   LSP object will be sent back to the PCC by PCRep message.

   If there is no error occurs, a PCRpt will be sent to the PCE to
   synchronize the LSP State.  After receiving the PCRpt message, the
   PCE should synchronize the path ID up with the egress PCC.  It MAY be
   done by the PCLabelUpd and PCLabelRpt messages defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   The procedures of passive stateful PCE path computation request/
   response with path ID allocation are shown below:

5.1.1.3.  Active Stateful PCE

   As defined in [RFC8231], a stateful PCE can update the LSP state
   actively if the LSP has been delegated to the PCE.

   If there is no error occurs in LSP update, a PCRpt will be sent to
   the PCE to synchronize the LSP State.  Else, the PCE should release
   the path ID if it is not applied.  After receiving the PCRpt message,
   the PCE should synchronize the path ID up with the egress PCC.  It
   MAY be done by the PCLabelUpd and PCLabelRpt messages defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   The procedures of active stateful PCE path update with path ID
   allocation are shown below:

   Also, a stateful PCE can initiate an SR path actively by PCInitiate
   message.  The procedure is shown below:

   Figure 5: Active Stateful PCE Path Initiation with Path ID Allocation

   Path ID synchronization needs to be done after any path ID changes.
   Thus, after receiving the PCC confirmation by PCRpt messages, the PCE
   should synchronize with the egress PCC.  Likewise, when LSP is
   delegeted, the path ID sychronization should be done as well.

5.1.2.  Stateless PCE

   This path ID request and reply in stateless mode can be done by other
   out-of-band mechanisms such as Netconf [RFC6241].  Out-of-band
   mechanisms are out of scope of this document and will be discussed in
   other documents.
