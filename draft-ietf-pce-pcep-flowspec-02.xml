<abstract>
 <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable of selecting
    the paths through a traffic engineered network.  These paths may be supplied
    in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited instructions
    issued by the PCE to network elements.  Both approaches use the PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path.</t>

 <t>Traffic flows may be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications".  RFC
    5575 defines the Flow Specification and describes how it may be distributed in BGP
    to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes.</t>

 <t>This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of
    Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed
    on each path that it is aware of.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

 <t><xref target="RFC4655"/> defines the Path Computation Element (PCE), a functional component
    capable of computing paths for use in traffic engineering networks.  PCE was originally
    conceived for use in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering (TE) networks
    to derive the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  However, the scope of PCE was quickly
    extended to make it applicable to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks, and more recent work
    has brought other traffic engineering technologies and planning applications into scope (for
    example, Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing" />).</t>

 <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).
    PCEP defines the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between
    PCE and PCE, enabling computation of path for MPLS-TE LSPs.</t>

 <t>Stateful PCE <xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable control of
    TE-LSPs by a PCE that retains state about the the LSPs provisioned in the network (a stateful PCE).
    <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup, maintenance, and teardown of LSPs initiated by a
    stateful PCE without the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
    network that is centrally controlled.  <xref target="RFC8283"/> introduces the architecture for PCE
    as a central controller and describes how PCE can be viewed as a component that performs computation
    to place &apos;flows&apos; within the network and decide how these flows are routed.</t>

 <t>Dissemination of traffic flow specifications (Flow Specifications) was introduced for BGP in
    <xref target="RFC5575" />.  A Flow Specification is comprised of traffic filtering rules and
    actions.  The routers that receive a Flow Specification can classify received packets according
    to the traffic filtering rules and can direct packets based on the actions.</t>

 <t>When a PCE is used to initiate tunnels (such as TE-LSPs or SR paths) using PCEP, it is important
    that the head end of the tunnels understands what traffic to place on each tunnel.  The data flows
    intended for a tunnel can be described using Flow Specifications, and when PCEP is in use for
    tunnel initiation it makes sense for that same protocol to be used to distribute the Flow
    Specifications that describe what data is to flow on those tunnels.</t>

 <t>This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications.
    The extensions include the creation, update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP, and can
    be applied to tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to the PCE by the
    PCC.  Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request to
    indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this in during the path computation.</t>

 <t>Flow Specifications are carried in TLVs within a new Flow Spec Object defined in this document.
    The flow filtering rules indicated by the Flow Specifications are mainly defined by BGP Flow
    Specifications.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">

 <t>This document uses the following terms defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>: PCC, PCE, PCEP Peer.</t>

 <t>The following term from <xref target="RFC5575"/> is used frequently throughout this
    document:
    <list style="empty">

       <t>Flow Specification (FlowSpec): A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several
          matching criteria that can be applied to IP traffic, including filters and actions.  Each
          FlowSpec consists of a set of filters and a set of actions.</t>

    </list></t>

 <t>This document uses the terms "stateful PCE" and "active PCE" as advocated in <xref target="RFC7399" />.</t>

 <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119" /> <xref target="RFC8174" /> when, and only when,
    they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

</section>

<section title="Procedures for PCE Use of Flow Specifications">

 <t>There are three elements of procedure:

    <list style="symbols">
       <t>A PCE and a PCC must be able to indicate whether or not they support the use of Flow
          Specifications.</t>

       <t>A PCE or PCC must be able to include Flow Specifications in PCEP messages with clear
          understanding of the applicability of those Flow Specifications in each case including
          whether the use of such information is mandatory, constrained, or optional, and how
          overlapping Flow Specifications will be resolved.</t>

       <t>Flow Specification information/state must be synchronized between PCEP peers so that,
          on recovery, the peers have the same understanding of which Flow Specifications apply.</t>
    </list></t>

 <t>The following subsections describe these points.</t>

 <section title="Capability Advertisement">

   <t>As with most PCEP capability advertisements, the ability to support Flow Specifications can be
      indicated in the PCEP OPEN message or in IGP PCE capability advertisements.</t>

   <section title="PCEP OPEN Message" anchor="open">

     <t>During PCEP session establishment, a PCC or PCE that supports the procedures described in
        this document announces this fact by including the "PCE FlowSpec Capability" TLV (described in
        <xref target="cap"/>) in the OPEN Object carried in the PCEP Open message.</t>

     <t>The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in a PCE&apos;s OPEN message
        indicates that the PCE can distribute FlowSpecs to PCCs and can receive FlowSpecs in messages
        from the PCCs.</t>

     <t>The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in a PCC&apos;s OPEN message
        indicates that the PCC supports the FlowSpec functionality described in this document.</t>

     <t>If either one of a pair of PCEP peers does not indicate support of the functionality described in
        this document by not including the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in its OPEN message,
        then the other peer MUST NOT include a FlowSpec object in any PCEP message sent to the peer that does
        not support the procedures.  If a FlowSpec object is received even though support has not been indicated,
        the receiver will respond with a PCErr message reporting the objects containing the FlowSpec as described
        in <xref target="RFC5440" />: that is, it will use &apos;Unknown Object&apos; if it does not support this
        specification, and &apos;Not supported object&apos; if it supports this specification but has not chosen
        to support FlowSpec objects on this PCEP session.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="IGP PCE Capabilities Advertisement">

     <t>The ability to advertise support for PCEP and PCE features in IGP advertisements is provided
        for OSPF in <xref target="RFC5088" /> and for IS-IS in <xref target="RFC5089" />.  The mechanism
        uses the PCE Discovery TLV which has a PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV containing bit-flags each of which
        indicates support for a different feature.</t>

     <t>This document defines a new PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV bit, the FlowSpec Capable flag (bit number TBD1).
        Setting the bit indicates that an advertising PCE supports the procedures defined in this document.</t>

     <t>Note that while PCE FlowSpec Capability may be advertised during discovery, PCEP speakers that wish to
        use Flow Specification in PCEP MUST negotiate PCE FlowSpec Capability during PCEP session setup, as
        specified in <xref target="open" />.  A PCC MAY initiate PCE FlowSpec Capability negotiation at PCEP
        session setup even if it did not receive any IGP PCE capability advertisement, and a PCEP peer that
        advertised support for FlowSpec in the IGP is not obliged to support these procedures on any given
        PCEP session.</t>

   </section>

 </section>

 <section title="Dissemination Procedures">

   <t>This section describes the procedures to support Flow Specifications in PCEP messages.</t>

   <t>The primary purpose of distributing Flow Specification information is to allow a PCE to indicate to
      a PCC what traffic it should place on a path (such as an LSP or an SR path).  This means that the
      Flow Specification may be included in:
      <list style="symbols">

         <t>PCInitiate messages so that an active PCE can indicate the traffic to place on a path at the time
            that the PCE instantiates the path.</t>

         <t>PCUpd messages so that an active PCE can indicate or change the traffic to place on a path
            that has already been set up.</t>

         <t>PCRpt messages so that a PCC can report the traffic that the PCC plans to place on the path.</t>

         <t>PCReq messages so that a PCC can indicate what traffic it plans to place on a path at the time it
            requests the PCE to perform a computation in case that information aids the PCE in its work.</t>

         <t>PCRep messages so that a PCE that has been asked to compute a path can suggest which traffic
            could be placed on a path that a PCC may be about to set up.</t>

         <t>PCErr messages so that issues related to paths and the traffic they carry can be reported to the
            PCE by the PCC, and so that problems with other PCEP messages that carry Flow Specifications can
            be reported.</t>
      </list></t>

   <t>To carry Flow Specifications in PCEP messages, this document defines a new PCEP object called the
      PCEP FLOWSPEC Object.  The object is OPTIONAL in the messages described above and MAY appear more
      than once in each message.</t>

   <t>The PCEP FLOWSPEC Object carries zero or one Flow Filter TLV which describes a traffic flow.</t>

   <t>The inclusion of multiple PCEP FLOWSPEC Objects allows multiple traffic flows to be placed on a single
      path.</t>

   <t>Once a PCE and PCC have established that they can both support the use of Flow Specifications in PCEP
      messages, such information may be exchanged at any time for new or existing paths.</t>

   <t>The application and prioritization of Flow Specifications is described in <xref target="priorities" />.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Flow Specification Synchronization">

   <t>The Flow Specifications are carried along with the LSP State information as per <xref target="RFC8231" />
      making the Flow Specifications part of the LSP database (LSP-DB).  Thus, the synchronization of the Flow
      Specification information is done as part of LSP-DB synchronization.  This may be achieved using normal
      state synchronization procedures as described in <xref target="RFC8231" /> or enhanced state synchronization
      procedures as defined in <xref target="RFC8232" />.</t>

   <t>The approach selected will be implementation and deployment specific and will depend on issues such as
      how the databases are constructed and what level of synchronization support is needed.</t>

 </section>

</section>

<section title="PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV" anchor="cap">

 <t>The PCE-FLOWSPEC-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV that can be carried in the OPEN Object
    <xref target="RFC5440"/> to exchange PCE FlowSpec capabilities of PCEP speakers.</t>

 <t>The format of the PCE-FLOWSPEC-CAPABILITY TLV follows the format of all PCEP TLVs
    as defined in <xref target="RFC5440" /> and is shown in <xref target="capfig" />.</t>

 <t>FS-ID (32-bits): A PCEP-specific identifier for the FlowSpec information.  A PCE
    or PCC creates an FS-ID for each FlowSpec that it originates, and the value is
    unique within the scope of that PCE or PCC and is constant for the lifetime of a
    PCEP session.  All subsequent PCEP messages can identify the FlowSpec using the
    FS-ID.  The values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF are reserved and MUST NOT be used.</t>

 <t>AFI (16-bits): Address Family Identifier as used in BGP <xref target="RFC4760"/>

<section title="Flow Filter TLV" anchor="tlv">

 <t>A new PCEP TLV is defined to convey Flow Specification filtering rules that specify

    in <xref target="RFC5440" />.  The Type field values come from the codepoint space for
    PCEP TLVs and has the value TBD4.</t>

 <t>The Value field contains one or more sub-TLVs (the Flow Specification TLVs) as defined in

 <t>Type values are chosen so that there can be commonality with Flow Specifications defined for use
    with BGP <xref target="RFC5575"/>.  This is possible because the BGP Flow Spec encoding uses a single octet to encode the

 1..255 is as per "Flow Spec IPv6 Component Types" <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6"/>.
 When future BGP specifications (such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn"/>) make further allocations 
 to the aforementioned registries, they are also inherited to be used in PCEP.</t>

 <t>The content of the Value field in each TLV is specific to the type/AFI and describes the parameters
    of the Flow Specification.  The definition of the format of many of these Value fields is inherited
    from BGP specifications as shown in <xref target="tlvFig" />.  Specifically, the inheritance is from
    <xref target="RFC5575"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6"/>, but may also be inherited
    from future BGP specifications. This is a non-exhaustive list for illustration purpose.</t>

 <t>When multiple Flow Specification TLVs are present in a single Flow Filter TLV they are combined to
    produce a more detailed description of a flow.  For examples and rules about how this is achieved,
    see <xref target="RFC5575"/>.</t>

 <t>An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a Flow Specification TLV with a type value
    that it does not recognize or does not support MUST respond with a PCErr message with error-type TBD8
    (FlowSpec Error), error-value 1 (Unsupported FlowSpec) and MUST NOT install the Flow Specification.</t>

 <t>When used in other protocols (such as BGP) these Flow Specifications are also associated with actions
    to indicate how traffic matching the Flow Specification should be treated.  In PCEP, however, the only
    action is to associate the traffic with a tunnel and to forward matching traffic on to that path, so
    no encoding of an action is needed.</t>

 <t><xref target="priorities" /> describes how overlapping Flow Specifications are prioritized and
    handled.</t>

 <t>All Flow Specification TLVs with Types in the range 1 to 255 have Values defined
    for use in BGP (for example, in <xref target="RFC5575"/>, 
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6"/>, and <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn"/>) and are set using the BGP encoding,
    but without the type or length octets (the relevant information is in the
    Type and Length fields of the TLV).  The Value field is padded with trailing
    zeros to achieve 4-byte alignment.</t>

 <t><xref target="I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls"/> defines a way to convey identification
    of a VPN in PCEP via a Route Distinguisher (RD) <xref target="RFC4364"/>
    encoded in ROUTE-DISTINGUISHER TLV.  A Flow Specification TLV with Type TBD5
    carries a Value field matching that present in the ROUTE-DISTINGUISHER TLV and is
    used to identify that other flow filter information (for example, an IPv4 destination
    prefix) is associated with a specific VPN identified by the RD.  See <xref target="vpn-id" />
    for further discussion of VPN identification.</t>

 <t>Although it may be possible to describe a multicast Flow Specification from the
    combination of other Flow Specification TLVs with specific values, it is more convenient
    to use a dedicated Flow Specification TLV.  Flow Specification TLVs with Type
    values TBD6 and TBD7 are used to identify a multicast flow for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
    The Value field is encoded as shown in <xref target="mcastfig" />.</t>

</section>


<section title="Detailed Procedures" anchor="detailed">

 <t>This section outlines some specific detailed procedures for using the protocol extensions
    defined in this document.</t>

 <section title="Default Behavior and Backward Compatibility" anchor="default">

    <t>The default behavior is that no Flow Specification is applied to a tunnel.  That is,
       the default is that the Flow Spec object is not used as is the case in all systems
       before the implementation of this specification.</t>

    <t>In this case it is a local matter (such as through configuration) how tunnel head ends
       are instructed what traffic to place on a tunnel.</t>

    <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes how receivers respond when they see unknown PCEP
       objects.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Composite Flow Specifications" anchor="composite">

   <t>Flow Specifications may be represented by a single Flow Specification TLV or may require a
      more complex description using multiple Flow Specification TLVs.  For example, a flow
      indicated by a source-destination pair of IPv6 addresses would be described by the
      combination of Destination IPv6 Prefix and Source IPv6 Prefix Flow Specification TLVs.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Modifying Flow Specifications" anchor="modify">

   <t>A PCE may want to modify a Flow Specification associated with a tunnel, or a PCC may
      want to report a change to the Flow Specification it is using with a tunnel.</t>

   <t>It is important that the specific Flow Specification is identified so that it is clear that
      this is a modification of an existing flow and not the addition of a new flow as described
      in <xref target="multiple" />.  The FS-ID field of the PCEP Flow Spec Object is used to
      identify a specific Flow Specification.</t>

   <t>When modifying a Flow Specification, all Flow Specification TLVs for the intended specification
      of the flow MUST be included in the PCEP Flow Spec Object and the FS-ID MUST be retained from the
      previous description of the flow.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Multiple Flow Specifications" anchor="multiple">

   <t>It is possible that multiple flows will be place on a single tunnel.  In some cases it is possible to
      to define these within a single PCEP Flow Spec Object: for example, two Destination IPv4 Prefix TLVs
      could be included to indicate that packets matching either prefix are acceptable.  PCEP would consider
      this as a single Flow Specification identified by a single FS-ID.</t>

   <t>In other scenarios the use of multiple Flow Specification TLVs would be confusing.  For example,
      if flows from A to B and from C to D are to be included then using two Source IPv4 Prefix TLVs
      and two Destination IPv4 Prefix TLVs would be confusing (are flows from A to D included?).  In these
      cases, each Flow Specification is carried in its own PCEP Flow Spec Object with multiple objects present
      on a single PCEP message.  Use of separate objects also allows easier removal and modification of Flow
      Specifications.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Adding and Removing Flow Specifications" anchor="addremove">

    <t>The Remove bit in the the PCEP Flow Spec Object is left clear when a Flow Specification is being
       added or modified.</t>

    <t>To remove a Flow Specification, a PCEP Flow Spec Object is included with the FS-ID matching the
       one being removed, and the R bit set to indicate removal.  In this case it is not necessary to
       include any Flow Specification TLVs.</t>

    <t>If the R bit is set and Flow Specification TLVs are present an implementation MAY ignore them.  If
       the implementation checks the Flow Specification TLVs against those recorded for the FS-ID of the
       Flow Specification being removed and finds a mismatch, the Flow Specification MUST still be removed
       and the implementation SHOULD record a local exception or log.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="VPN Identifiers" anchor="vpn-id">

   <t>VPN instances are identified in BGP using Route Distinguishers (RDs) <xref target="RFC4364"/>.  These
      values are not normally considered to have any meaning outside of the network, and they are not encoded
      in data packets belonging to the VPNs.  However, RDs provide a useful way of identifying VPN instances
      and are often manually or automatically assigned to VPNs as they are provisioned.</t>

   <t>Thus the RD provides a useful way to indicate that traffic for a particular VPN should be placed on a
      given tunnel.  The tunnel head end will need to interpret this Flow Specification not as a filter on
      the fields of data packets, but using the other mechanisms that it already uses to identify VPN traffic.
      This could be based on the incoming port (for port-based VPNs) or may leverage knowledge of the VRF that
      is in use for the traffic.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Priorities and Overlapping Flow Specifications" anchor="priorities">

   <t>TBD</t>

   <t>An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a Flow Specification that it cannot resolve
      against other Flow Specifications already installed MUST respond with a PCErr message with error-type TBD8
      (FlowSpec Error), error-value 3 (Unresolvable conflict) and MUST NOT install the Flow Specification.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">

 <t>We may assume that a system that utilizes a remote PCE is subject to a number of
    vulnerabilities that could allow spurious LSPs or SR paths to be established or that
    could result in existing paths being modified or torn down.  Such systems, therefore,
    apply security considerations as described in <xref target="RFC5440" />,
    <xref target="RFC6952" />, and <xref target="RFC8253" />.</t>

 <t>The description of Flow Specifications associated with paths set up or controlled by a
    PCE add a further detail that could be attacked without tearing down LSPs or SR paths,
    but causing traffic to be misrouted within the network.  Therefore, the use of the security
    mechanisms for PCEP referenced above is important.</t>

 <t>Visibility into the information carried in PCEP does not have direct privacy concerns for
    end-users&apos; data, however, knowledge of how data is routed in a network may make that
    data more vulnerable.  Of course, the ability to interfere with the way data is routed also
    makes the data more vulnerable.  Furthermore, knowledge of the connected end-points (such as
    multicast receivers or VPN sites) is usually considered private customer information.  Therefore,
    implementations or deployments concerned to protect privacy MUST apply the mechanisms described
    in the documents referenced above.</t>

 <t>Experience with Flow Specifications in BGP systems indicates that they can become complex and
    that the overlap of Flow Specifications installed in different orders can lead to unexpected
    results.  Although this is not directly a security issue per se, the confusion and unexpected
    forwarding behavior may be engineered or exploited by an attacker.  Therefore, implementers and
    operators SHOULD pay careful attention to the Manageability Considerations described in
    <xref target="Manage" />.</t>
