    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
      Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
      (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths in
      SR networks.</t>

      <t>This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
      unidirectional SR Paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR path when
      using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as
      well as when using a Stateless PCE.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Segment routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402"/> leverages the source
      routing and tunneling paradigms. SR supports to steer packets into an
      explicit forwarding path at the ingress node.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
      purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well
      as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE
      LSP) characteristics.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
      enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
      compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>. It includes mechanisms to
      effect LSP State Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of
      control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of
      path computations within and across PCEP sessions. The model of
      operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref
      target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/> specifies extensions to
      the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      for SR networks, that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate SR-TE
      paths, as well as a PCC to request, report or delegate SR paths. <xref
      target="I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6"/> extend PCEP to support SR
      for IPv6 data plane.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> introduces a generic
      mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
      associations between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes, for
      example primary and secondary LSP associations, and is equally
      applicable to the active and passive modes of a Stateful PCE <xref
      target="RFC8231"/> or a stateless PCE <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

      <t>Currently, SR network only supports uni-directional path, but the
      bidirectional SR path is required in some scenarios, for example, mobile
      backhaul transport network. The requirement of SR bidirectional path is
      specified in <xref target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> defines PCEP
      extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an
      Associated Bidirectional LSP when using a Stateful PCE for both
      PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when using a Stateless
      PCE.</t>

      <t>This document extends the bidirectional association to segment
      routing by specifying PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
      unidirectional SR paths into a bi-directional SR path.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> specify the
      Double-sided Bidirectional procedure, where the PCE creates the
      association and provisions at the both ends, the RSVP-TE does the
      signaling to the egress the status of the forward LSP and the ingress
      about the reverse LSP. Thus the both ends learn both the LSPs forming
      the bi-directional association. In case of SR, to support the
      bi-directional use-case, this is done via the PCEP protocol itself as
      described in <xref target="double-sided"/>. This is done so that both
      ends are aware of the path segment/ID used by each of the
      uni-directional LSP, as well as the status, the ERO etc.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment"/> defines a procedure for
      path ID in PCEP for SR by defining the PATH-ID TLV. The path ID can be a
      path segment in SR-MPLS <xref
      target="I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>, or a path ID in SRv6
      <xref target="I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np"/>, or other IDs that
      can identify an SR path. The PATH-ID SHOULD be included for associated
      bidirectional SR paths.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This memo makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing"/>. The reader is assumed to be
      familiar with the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref
      target="RFC8231"/>, <xref target="RFC8281"/>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PCEP Extension for Bi-directional SR Path">
      <t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>, LSPs are
      associated by adding them to a common association group. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> specifies PCEP extensions for
      grouping two reverse unidirectional MPLS-TE LSPs into an Associated
      Bidirectional LSP for both single-sided and double-sided initiation
      cases by defining two new Bidirectional LSP Association Groups.</t>

      <t>This document extends the procedure for SR bidirectional associated
      paths by defining a new bidirectional association type (i.e.
      Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group). The document
      further describe the mechanism of associating two unidirectional SR path
      into a bidirectional SR path. <xref
      target="I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment"/> defines a procedure for path ID in
      PCEP for SR by defining the PATH-ID TLV. The bidirectional SR path MUST
      also use the PATH-ID TLV.</t>

      <t>Note that a new association type is created by this document to
      create new procedures applicable to SR-path (and are quite different to
      the RSVP-TE bi-directional association groups).</t>

      <section anchor="double-sided"
               title="Double-sided Bidirectional SR Path Association Group Object">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>, two
        LSPs are associated as a bi-directional MPLS-TE LSP by a common
        bi-directional LSP association group. For associating two SR paths,
        this document defines a new association group called 'Double-sided
        Bidirectional SR Path Association Group' as follows: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Association Type (TBD1 to be assigned by IANA) = Double-sided
            Bidirectional SR Path Association Group</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Similar to other bidirectional associations, this Association Type
        is operator-configured in nature and statically created by the
        operator on the PCEP peers. The paths belonging to this association is
        conveyed via PCEP messages to the PCEP peer. Operator-configured
        Association Range TLV <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>
        MUST NOT be sent for these Association Types, and MUST be ignored, so
        that the entire range of association ID can be used for them. The
        handling of the Association ID, Association Source, optional Global
        Association Source and optional Extended Association ID in this
        association are set in the same way as <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>

        <t>A member of the Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association
        Group can take the role of a forward or reverse SR path and follows
        the rules similar to the rules defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> for LSPs.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An SR path (forward or reverse) can not be part of more than
            one Double-sided Bi-directional SR Path Association Group.</t>

            <t>The endpoints of the SR paths in this associations cannot be
            different.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For describing the SR paths in this association group, such as
        direction and co-routed information, this association group reuses the
        Bi-directional LSP Association Group TLV defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>. All fields and processing
        rules are as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Bi-directional Flag">
      <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, the B-flag in RP object MUST
      be set when the PCC specifies that the path computation request relates
      to a bi-directional TE LSP. In this document, the B-flag also MUST be
      set when the PCC specifies that the path computation request relates to
      a bi-directional SR path. When a stateful PCE initiates or updates a
      bi-directional SR paths including LSPs and SR paths, the B-flag in SRP
      object <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls"/> may be set
      as well.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Procedures of Bi-directional Path Computation">
      <t>Two uni-directional SR paths can be associated by the association
      group object as specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>. A bidirectional LSP
      association group object is defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> (for MPLS-TE). This documents
      extends the mechanism for bidirectional SR paths. Two SR paths can be
      associated together by including the Bi-directional SR Path Association
      Group in the PCEP messages. The PATH-ID TLV <xref
      target="I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment"/> SHOULD also be included in the LSP
      object for these SR paths.</t>

      <t>There is also a need to include the reverse direction path in the
      PCEP messages, to do this the PCE SHOULD inform the reverse SR path to
      the ingress PCC and vice versa. To achieve this a PCInitiate message for
      the reverse SR path is sent to the ingress PCC and a PCInitiate message
      for the forward SR path is sent to the egress PCC (with the same
      association group). These PCInitiate message MUST NOT trigger initiation
      of SR paths. The information of reverse direction path can be used for
      several scenarios, such as directed BFD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/>.</t>

      <!--<t>After path computation, the bi-directional path that combined by two
      SR paths and associated by an association group object will be sent to
      the source and destination PCC( as known as the ingress node and egress
      node in SR) by PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate messages, respectively. </t>-->

      <!--<t>A PCEP message such as PCRep or PCUdp or PCInitiate, containing a
      bi-directional path, sent to the PCC contains a forward direction path
      beginning from itself to the remote PCC and a reverse path from the
      remote PCC back to the PCC itself. The information of reverse direction
      path can be used for several scenarios, such as directed BFD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/>.</t>-->

      <section title="PCE Initiated SR Paths">
        <t>As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-group"/>
        Bidirectional SR Association Group can be created by a Stateful
        PCE.</t>

      <!--<section title="Stateless PCE">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>, for
        a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path computation
        request to an association group, thus enabling it to associate a
        common set of configuration parameters or behaviors with the request.
        A PCC can request co-routed or non co-routed forward and reverse
        direction paths from a stateless PCE for a bidirectional LSP
        association group.</t>

      <t>A new Association Type for the Association Object, Double-sided

      Types. Hence, securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer Security
