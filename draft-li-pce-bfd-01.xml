   This document describes the extensions to the Path Computation Element 
   (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) to notify Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   parameters for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) from PCE to Path Computation Client (PCC) for PCE-initiated LSP.  The
   extensions include BFD protocol parameters and allow PCC to support
   BFD for PCE-Initiated LSP. Further, support for bi-directional co-routed BFD channel is provided.</t>

	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   <xref target="RFC5884"/> describes the applicability of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in relation to
   Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping for detecting rapidly a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   LSP data plane failure.  It also describes
   procedures for using BFD in MPLS environment.  The LSP (for which BFD is used to detect failure)
   can be a bidirectional LSP or an unidirectional LSP (so long as there is
   some return path).  In case of bidirectional LSP, it should be noted that, if the path from ingress LSR to egress LSR is not
   co-routed with the path from egress LSR to ingress LSR, the failure
   to deliver BFD control packets from egress LSR to ingress LSR can
   lead to false negatives, making ingress LSR deduces that the LSP has
   failed. <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/> proposes a solution to instruct the
   egress to use an explicit path for its BFD control packets
   associated with a particular BFD session.</t>

   <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/>
   defines the mechanisms for the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
   between two PCEs. <xref target="RFC8231"/> describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful
   control for stateful PCE. </t>

	<t>
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/>
   introduces the procedure of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model where the setup and teardown is initiated by the PCE, without the need for local configuration
   on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.
   The PCC creates the LSP using the attributes
   communicated by the PCE (and local values for any unspecified
   parameters) and initiate setup of the LSP. 
   <!--PCC will automatically set up the MPLS RSVP-TE LSP according
   to the explicit path PCE provides.-->  BFD session for the PCE-initiated
   LSP can also be created dynamically based on the BFD parameters set by the 
   PCE at the same time as LSP creation without a need for local configuration on the PCC. 
   Note that for the explicitly routed LSP, it is likely that the
   shortest return path to the ingress would not follow the
   same path as the LSP in the forward direction and is thus
   would face false positive. As discussed earlier, <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/> defines
   a mechanism to form bi-directional co-routed associated channel for BFD sessions.</t>

	<t>
   This document describes the extensions to the PCEP to include BFD
   parameters for LSPs from PCE to PCC for PCE-initiated LSP.  The PCC would further set up BFD session for the PCE-Initiated LSP. 
   Apart for setup, PCE could also modify or remove BFD session for PCE-Initiated LSP.</t>

	<!--<t>
   The BFD control packets can be exchanged over a bi-directional co-
   routed channel.</t>-->

	<t>
   The PCE could set the BFD protocol parameters, such as detection time multiplier,
   desired Min TX Interval, required Min RX Interval for PCE-initiated
   LSP. In case PCE does not explicitly set these, then the PCC could set these values from a local template or configuration (at PCC).
   <!--The extensions of PCEP include generic BFD protocol parameters too.
   It can be used to notify PCC by PCE to adjust these parameters for
   special LSP.--> 

   </t>
   <t>This document proposes two modes to bootstrap BFD session for PCE-Initiated LSP, one without the use of LSP-ping where the PCE sets the BFD Discriminators for the forward and reverse LSPs. The second involves the use of LSP Ping by Ingress as usual.</t>

	<section title="Bootstrapping BFD Session" anchor="section-3"><t>
   <!--PCE computes the path for one LSP from the ingress LSR to egress LSR
   and initiates the creation of this LSP on ingress LSR.  The LSP is
   called as LSP1.  PCE can initiate the creation of LSP on egress LSR
   according to the co-routed path from egress LSR to ingress LSR.  The
   LSP is called as LSP2.-->
   At the time of PCE-initiation of the LSP, PCE could also request the
   setup of the BFD session for the LSP to monitor the data plane. 
   The LSP could be uni-directional or bi-directional. In case of 
   bi-directional LSP, a co-routed bi-directional BFD session is 
   setup.    
   </t>

	<!--<t>
   To make the BFD session for LSP1 over the co-routed path to avoid the
   false detection there are two solutions as below:</t>-->

	<section title="Bootstrapping BFD session without LSP Ping" anchor="section-3.1"><t>
   BFD for MPLS LSP uses LSP Ping to carry the local discriminators to
   bootstrap the BFD session in order to associate the FEC representing
   the LSP with the BFD session indicated by the discriminators.  But the PCE could 
   also be used to allocate and set the pair of discriminators at the Ingress and Egress, in which case the initial LSP Ping is not needed. 
   This mode is applicable only for the double-sided bi-directional LSP that are initiated at the Ingress PCC and the Egress PCC, explicitly by the PCE.
   </t>

	<t>Consider, the forward LSP from the ingress LSR to egress LSR is
   called LSP1. The PCE initiates LSP1 at the Ingress. Further PCE also initiates the creation of reverse LSP on egress LSR
   according to the co-routed path from egress LSR to ingress LSR.  The
   LSP is called as LSP2.</t>
   <t>
   PCE also updates to the ingress LSR and egress LSR to set up BFD session for LSP1 and LSP2
   by the PCEP extension (as per this document), by setting the pair of BFD discriminators at the ingress and egress
   PCCs. Thus, it is not necessary to send LSP ping to bootstrap the BFD
   session.  The 'my discriminator' in BFD control packets along LSP1 is 'your
   discriminator' in BFD control packets along LSP2 and vice versa.</t>

	<t>
   By this method the same BFD session is set up not only for LSP1 but
   also LSP2.</t>

	<t>The mechanism by which a PCE allocates the BFD discriminator is out of scope of this document.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Bootstrapping BFD session with LSP Ping" anchor="section-3.2">
   <t>As per <xref target="RFC5884"/>, a BFD session is bootstrapped using LSP Ping. To establish a BFD session, an LSP Ping
   Echo request message carry the local discriminator assigned by
   the ingress LSR for the BFD session. The egress LSR respond with an LSP Ping Echo
   reply message that carries the local discriminator assigned by it for
   the BFD session. The BFD control packet uses the discriminator as exchanges via the LSP Ping Echo request and Echo reply messages.</t>

   <t>During the LSP initiation, PCE can also update the BFD parameters to the ingress. Note that in this mode, the BFD discriminators are allocated by LSRs and not set by the PCE.</t>

   <t>As per the mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC5884"/> and <xref target="RFC5886"/>, the reverse direction of the BFD session 
   would follow the shortest path route and that might lead to the problem in detecting failures. 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/> defines the
   BFD Reverse Path TLV as an extension to LSP Ping <xref target="RFC8029"/>
   and proposes that it to be used to instruct the egress BFD peer to
   use specified path for its BFD control packets associated with the
   particular BFD session. In this way the forward and reverse directions of the BFD session can form a
   bi-directional co-routed associated channel.</t>

	<!--<t>
   After PCE initiates PCC to set up the LSP PCC delegates the MPLS
   RSVP-LSP with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV including FEC information to PCE.
   Therefore after ingress LSR and egress LSR set up the LSP1 and LSP2
   independently they will delegate the LSP1 and LSP2 FEC information to
   PCE independently.</t>-->

  <t>BFD Reverse Path TLV contains the target FEC to identify the specified reverse path
      that the BFD control packets is required to follow. For PCE-Initiated LSPs, the PCE can also 
      provide this information along with other BFD parameters.</t> 
      <t>In case of double-sided bi-directional LSP, the PCE MUST
      first initiate the LSPs - LSP1 in forward and LSP2 in reverse direction. The Ingress 
      and Egress PCC would report the status of the LSP as well as the parameters to identify the FEC. The PCE SHOULD
      then use the FEC as part of BFD Reverse Path TLV along with other BFD parameters as part of PCUpd message for LSP1 and LSP2. 
      The PCC would then follow the procedure in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/>
      to set up a bi-directional co-routed BFD channel. Two BFD sessions are set up for LSP1 and LSP2
      independently.</t>


	<!--<t>
   PCE notify ingress LSR to set up BFD session for LSP1 carrying the
   FEC information about the reverse LSP, LSP2.  The information
   received by ingress LSR via PCEP can be set to the BFD Reverse Path
   TLV in the LSP Ping message.  Following the procedure defined in
   [draft-ietf-mpls-bfd-directed-02] the BFD session would be a bi-
   directional co-routed channel and no false detection would be
   notified.</t>-->

	<!--<t>
   PCE notify Egress LSR to set up BFD session for LSP2 following the
   same process above.</t>

	<t>
   By this method two BFD sessions are set up for LSP1 and LSP2
   independently.</t>-->
