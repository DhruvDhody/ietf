1.  Introduction

   [RFC5884] describes the applicability of Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) in relation to Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping for
   detecting rapidly a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LSP data
   plane failure.  It also describes procedures for using BFD in MPLS
   environment.  The LSP (for which BFD is used to detect failure) can
   be a bidirectional LSP or an unidirectional LSP (so long as there is
   some return path).  In case of bidirectional LSP, it should be noted
   that, if the path from ingress LSR to egress LSR is not co-routed

   with the path from egress LSR to ingress LSR, the failure to deliver
   BFD control packets from egress LSR to ingress LSR can lead to false
   negatives, making ingress LSR deduces that the LSP has failed.
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed] proposes a solution to instruct the
   egress to use an explicit path for its BFD control packets associated
   with a particular BFD session.

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   defines the mechanisms for the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
   between two PCEs.  [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   provide stateful control for stateful PCE.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] introduces the procedure of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model where the setup and
   teardown is initiated by the PCE, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.  The
   PCC creates the LSP using the attributes communicated by the PCE (and
   local values for any unspecified parameters) and initiate setup of
   the LSP.  BFD session for the PCE-initiated LSP can also be created
   dynamically based on the BFD parameters set by the PCE at the same
   time as LSP creation without a need for local configuration on the
   PCC.  Note that for the explicitly routed LSP, it is likely that the
   shortest return path to the ingress would not follow the same path as
   the LSP in the forward direction and is thus would face false
   positive.  As discussed earlier, [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed] defines
   a mechanism to form bi-directional co-routed associated channel for
   BFD sessions.

   This document describes the extensions to the PCEP to include BFD
   parameters for LSPs from PCE to PCC for PCE-initiated LSP.  The PCC
   would further set up BFD session for the PCE-Initiated LSP.  Apart
   for setup, PCE could also modify or remove BFD session for PCE-
   Initiated LSP.

   The PCE could set the BFD protocol parameters, such as detection time
   multiplier, desired Min TX Interval, required Min RX Interval for
   PCE-initiated LSP.  In case PCE does not explicitly set these, then
   the PCC could set these values from a local template or configuration
   (at PCC).

   This document proposes two modes to bootstrap BFD session for PCE-
   Initiated LSP, one without the use of LSP-ping where the PCE sets the
   BFD Discriminators for the forward and reverse LSPs.  The second
   involves the use of LSP Ping by Ingress as usual.

2.  Terminology

   BFD: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   LSP: Label Switching Path

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC8231]: Stateful
   PCE, delegation.

   The following term is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]:
   PCE-initiated LSP: LSP that is instantiated as a result of a request
   from the PCE.

3.  Bootstrapping BFD Session

   At the time of PCE-initiation of the LSP, PCE could also request the
   setup of the BFD session for the LSP to monitor the data plane.  The
   LSP could be uni-directional or bi-directional.  In case of bi-
   directional LSP, a co-routed bi-directional BFD session is setup.

3.1.  Bootstrapping BFD session without LSP Ping

   BFD for MPLS LSP uses LSP Ping to carry the local discriminators to
   bootstrap the BFD session in order to associate the FEC representing
   the LSP with the BFD session indicated by the discriminators.  But
   the PCE could also be used to allocate and set the pair of
   discriminators at the Ingress and Egress, in which case the initial
   LSP Ping is not needed.  This mode is applicable only for the double-
   sided bi-directional LSP that are initiated at the Ingress PCC and
   the Egress PCC, explicitly by the PCE.

   Consider, the forward LSP from the ingress LSR to egress LSR is
   called LSP1.  The PCE initiates LSP1 at the Ingress.  Further PCE
   also initiates the creation of reverse LSP on egress LSR according to
   the co-routed path from egress LSR to ingress LSR.  The LSP is called
   as LSP2.

   PCE also updates to the ingress LSR and egress LSR to set up BFD
   session for LSP1 and LSP2 by the PCEP extension (as per this
   document), by setting the pair of BFD discriminators at the ingress
   and egress PCCs.  Thus, it is not necessary to send LSP ping to
   bootstrap the BFD session.  The 'my discriminator' in BFD control
   packets along LSP1 is 'your discriminator' in BFD control packets
   along LSP2 and vice versa.

Internet-Draft           PCEP Extensions for BFD            October 2017


   By this method the same BFD session is set up not only for LSP1 but
   also LSP2.

   The mechanism by which a PCE allocates the BFD discriminator is out
   of scope of this document.

3.2.  Bootstrapping BFD session with LSP Ping

   As per [RFC5884], a BFD session is bootstrapped using LSP Ping.  To
   establish a BFD session, an LSP Ping Echo request message carry the
   local discriminator assigned by the ingress LSR for the BFD session.
   The egress LSR respond with an LSP Ping Echo reply message that
   carries the local discriminator assigned by it for the BFD session.
   The BFD control packet uses the discriminator as exchanges via the
   LSP Ping Echo request and Echo reply messages.

   During the LSP initiation, PCE can also update the BFD parameters to
   the ingress.  Note that in this mode, the BFD discriminators are
   allocated by LSRs and not set by the PCE.

   As per the mechanism defined in [RFC5884] and [RFC5886], the reverse
   direction of the BFD session would follow the shortest path route and
   that might lead to the problem in detecting failures.
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed] defines the BFD Reverse Path TLV as an
   extension to LSP Ping [RFC8029] and proposes that it to be used to
   instruct the egress BFD peer to use specified path for its BFD
   control packets associated with the particular BFD session.  In this
   way the forward and reverse directions of the BFD session can form a
   bi-directional co-routed associated channel.

   BFD Reverse Path TLV contains the target FEC to identify the
   specified reverse path that the BFD control packets is required to
   follow.  For PCE-Initiated LSPs, the PCE can also provide this
   information along with other BFD parameters.

   In case of double-sided bi-directional LSP, the PCE MUST first
   initiate the LSPs - LSP1 in forward and LSP2 in reverse direction.
   The Ingress and Egress PCC would report the status of the LSP as well
   as the parameters to identify the FEC.  The PCE SHOULD then use the
   FEC as part of BFD Reverse Path TLV along with other BFD parameters
   as part of PCUpd message for LSP1 and LSP2.  The PCC would then
   follow the procedure in [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed] to set up a bi-
   directional co-routed BFD channel.  Two BFD sessions are set up for
   LSP1 and LSP2 independently.

                       The BFD-Capability TLV format

   The Type of the TLV is (TBD1) and it has a fixed Length of 4 octets.

   The value comprises a single field - Flags (32 bits).  No flags are
   defined for this TLV in this document.

   Unassigned bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Advertisement of the BFD-Capability TLV implies support of BFD for
   PCE-initiated LSP, as well as the TLVs, sub-TLVs and procedures
   defined in this document.

4.2.  BFD TLV

   The BFD TLV provides the BFD parameters of the BFD session.  This is
   an optional TLV for the LSPA Object.  This TLV is included in the
   LSPA Object with the PCInitiate or the PCUpd message.  The presence
   of this TLV indicates that the PCE has requested the BFD session to
   be set for the LSP.

   The format of the BFD TLV is shown in the following figure:
